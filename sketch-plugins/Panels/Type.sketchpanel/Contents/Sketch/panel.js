The results are simply flat due to lack of good ideas for improvements. Whether the ads are put in a local newspaper or are printed in the famous periodical or posted on a website, the money invested should gain the desired outcome. There are some common mistakes small businesses and professional service providers do when designing and posting the advertisement, which leads to the failure of the advertisement.\n\nBigger is better is believed in by many. That’s exactly what some of the small firms think when they want to advertise their product. They think bigger and select a medium where they need to invest a lot of money, but do not reach the targeted market. Like if a company specializes in designing diet plans and want to help out people who had disappointing results from their individual diet plans, and the company chooses to advertise a full page in the local paper instead of running advertisement in a health magazine, obviously not many of the dieters will notice the advertisement and the advertisement doesn’t get the desired attention. So the point is to come up with the best campaign, which will increase the probability of the ad getting viewed and the right customers trying to buy the product or sign up for the service. Studies and research can be carried out on the market and targeted audience can be narrowed down. Once getting the list of newspapers, magazines and magazines meant for the customers in mind, find out how many readers they have and the cost they ask for posting the ad. Special deals are offered by them from time to time and can only be found by watchful eye.\n\nIt is estimated that everyday people are subjected to around three thousand commercials. That is a huge number and if someone desires to be noticed, he should certainly be different. Not only the services and product sold should be unique in the market, so should be the advertisement. For example, if a business selling mattresses says, “We sell mattresses”, it will not make a statement and will be passed off as any other mattress advertisement. But if they say, “Our mattresses are of the finest quality”, it will make the advertisement stand out in the crowd. Other catch lines are “Are you suffering from back pain? Probably you must try our mattresses “, are more specific and will catch the fancy of the people who are suffering from back pains since a long time. The advertisement should also focus on the uniqueness of the product and how it is better compared to the competitors’ product.\n\nFocusing on the problems of the customers and giving a solution for them, is what a customer demands. A customer does not buy a product; he buys benefits in the form of a product. The real value of the product should be realized and a clear picture of it should be presented to the customer so he will be able to relate with the product. If the advertisement doesn’t specify the solution it can provide, the customers will never know of it. So focusing on the customers problem is what some ads miss.  The last thing missing in most of the advertisement is motivation for the customers. If the advertiser has designed the advertisement and the customer had read the advertisement, all efforts and money invested will be wasted if he doesn’t get up and do something about it. It shouldn’t be assumed that the customer knows what to do; instead the advertisement should influence the mind of the customer and should tell him what to do. Call of action is the final job of the advertisement. It should call for information, or visiting the store or even visiting the online store. The message should sound confident and clear."},{title:"6 Powerful Tips To Creating Testimonials That Sell Your Products Fast",body:"There are many ways to market a product or a service and providing the potential clients and customers with testimonials is one of the best ways to market. \n\nThe power of testimonials can never be underestimated. People, especially nowadays, will only purchase products or avail services which have been referred to them by people whom they know. But most of the times, this is not an option that is in the hands of the business owner, he has to do the next best thing, which is to get testimonials from his past clients. Testimonials are living statements from past customers or clients which states that they were satisfied by the product/ service. Every business must have testimonials to be able to stand out in the ever crowded markets.\n\nThere are many benefits of having testimonials. Here are some of them.\n\nTestimonials appease the target market\n\nTestimonials usually lessen the doubts of the target market. There are a lot of scammers and con artists nowadays, and this has turned the market into a fearsome one. Credible testimonials provide security to the people who are eyeing at a certain product or service. The provision of testimonials gives people a much more relaxed attitude towards a product or service.\n\nTestimonials assure quality\n\nAside from confirming the existence of a business and lessening doubts, testimonials provide assurance to potential customers and clients of the quality of the product or service. The fact that they took time out to be able to write testimonials about the product reflect their levels of satisfaction towards the product/service.\n\nTestimonials give advantage\n\nCredible testimonials provide a competitive advantage for the product/service. There are many products and services out there and one of the ways to stand out from the rest is the use of credible testimonials.\n\nThere are many types of testimonials. Testimonials are usually categorized according to the source. Here are a few examples:\n\na) Testimonials from satisfied customers\n\nThis is probably the most effective type of testimonial. Nothing beats a testimonial from a satisfied customer because it is a picture of what the product/service is all about.\n\nb) Testimonials from experts\n\nExperts can be credible sources of testimonials. If a renowned dermatologist writes a testimonial for a beauty soap, it will surely help in boosting its sales, wouldn’t it?\n\nc) Testimonials from celebrities\n\nIn a world that is run by mass media, celebrities have become powerful sources of testimonials. Today, even infomercials are infested by testimonials from celebrities. People may think that getting testimonials from celebrities will cost a lot, but if it’s a real testimonial, celebrities may even waive their talent fees.\n\nThere is much more to making a testimonial an effective tool for marketing than gathering them. Good testimonials are the ones which can be compressed into a few catchy words. “I lost 20 pounds in two weeks time!” is an example of an eye-catching testimonial. However, one must never rephrase or edit what the client had said. How to get the right kinds of testimonials will be discussed later.\n\nCredible testimonials should also contain the complete attributes of the people who gave them. Their titles, location and age should be included whenever possible.\n\nVisual appeal will also be a great help in using testimonials. If the clients are willing, one must insist in taking photographs or videos for their testimonials. So how does a business owner get started with the whole testimonial thing? Here are some steps on how to archive testimonials.\n\n1. Before anything else, only products/ services with outstanding quality deserve testimonials, so one must make sure that his product/service possesses exceptional quality.\n\n2. Ask the help of your customers. One must be able to communicate to his customers his need of getting their testimonials. If they are really satisfied with the product/service, they would be more than willing to participate.\n\n3. Interview your customers. Ask them about what they like about your product/service, why they chose your product and other questions like these.\n\n4. Ask them if they are willing to make a written testimonial. You can offer to make the testimonial yourself based on their responses during the interview but the testimonial is still up for their approval. You might want to make the wordings catchy and let them approve the testimonials.\n\n5. Ask them if you could record the testimonial using a tape recorder or video cam. A video testimonial is better, but of course, many people are camera-shy and this can be a limited option for most.\n\n6. Choose the best testimonials. Use the best ones so as to maximize the benefits that your product can get from the testimonials.\n\nTestimonials are very powerful and this is the reason why every business should have them. They provide assurance and security and reflect the real essence of a product or a service."},{title:"Branding Do You Know Who You Are",body:"There is such a lot of talk going around about branding, but what exactly is your brand and how do you use it to help you reach more people and market your products or services? Your brand is the core of your marketing, the central theme around your products and services.\n\nYour brand is not your Logo or your Company Name, unless of course you are Microsoft or the Yellow Pages online directory.\n\nFor people to come and hire you, or buy from you in droves, your brand needs to be crystal clear, attractive, exciting and powerful.

Your Brand Tip 3 Think like your potential customer, try to get inside their head and see your products or services from their point of view. How do they experience what you do, and how does it make them feel? Your Brand Tip 4 What is it you do that makes you stand out from the crowd? If you don’t think you do, then you need to think of a way that you can, because your brand should be somehow different from everyone else’s, its not enough to be just the same as others but better. Your Brand Tip 5 What are your best abilities, do you know your greatest strengths? Choose an unbiased person, who knows you well, to help you decide what your top attributes are; your brand should be based around your unique strengths and abilities. Ultimately, creating a strong, memorable, compelling and meaningful brand is essential for successful marketing, and something you can do with a bit of thought, and may be a bit of help from your (unbiased) friends."},{title:"Illustration In Marketing Materials",body:"Not so many years ago businesses used to grunt at using illustrations in their marketing materials. But today, the use and influence of illustrations is growing right along. An illustration, image or picture that does not express a distinct idea is a poor illustration.

Originality cannot help flowing from the pencil of the good artist      "},{title:"Study 800 Numbers Still Popular With Advertisers",body:"Despite growth of the Internet over the past seven years, the use of toll-free phone numbers in television advertising continues to grow, indicating that the telephone remains a prevalent response tool, according to a recent study.\n\nThe 2005 Toll-free Numbers in Television Advertising study, commissioned by 800response, concluded that 35 percent of all television commercials feature phone numbers, and 82 percent of those phone numbers are toll-free. Furthermore, 74 percent of the toll-free numbers in television ads use the 800 prefix. Of the 800 numbers, 61 percent are “vanity” numbers, meaning they spell out a word or company name.\n\nA similar study conducted in 1998 concluded that 24 percent of TV commercials displayed toll-free numbers. At that time, just 55 percent were vanity 800 numbers. The 2005 study of 5,524 television commercials from four networks in four major markets found that vanity 800 phone numbers are increasingly prevalent in today’s television ads, up approximately 6 percent. The 800 prefix remains the leader as a direct response tool over 866, 877 and 888 prefixes. The study found that these prefixes come in far behind the 800 prefix for usage in television advertising at 6 percent, 8 percent and 12 percent respectively.\n\n“Over the last seven years, advertisers continue to understand that using a unique and memorable mechanism in television advertisements increases their response rates,” said Mitchell Knisbacher, president of 800response, a provider of vanity 800 numbers and toll-free service. “The two TV studies, over the past seven years, prove that 800 toll-free and vanity number usage in advertising is still strong, and growing. Advertisers continue to provide their customers with phone numbers so they can make contact with a live person, notwithstanding the spectacular growth of the Web.”"},{title:"Making A New Trend In Poster Printing",body:"Poster can be one of the effective marketing and advertising materials.

Sometimes, decoding what is said with what is meant is difficult at best. However, communication is a necessary tool in todays world. And it’s not only speaking that can be difficult, but trying to interpret body language, and other language barriers are just a few of the obstacles barring effective communication. It’s often been the case were one party completely miscommunicates to another due to a misunderstanding between parties. \n\nMost people learn to talk when they are relatively young. Gaining in verbal capacity as the get older and engage in conversation with more and more people throughout their lives.  And while most people will spend their time constantly speaking, some never really learn to listen, which is the king of effective communication. It may seem strange to hear such a thing as this, but it’s true. Even though it may not sound true to the individual who just spent the last couple moments listening to some co-worker blather on about his fantasy football picks, but it is.  Without proper listening, speech communication would just be a lot of annoying sounds. Unfortunately, most of the time we spend listening, really is just the process of physically absorbing the annoying squawks and squeaks that come out of someone.  \n\nThe problem with listening is that it’s so hard. It’s even harder to Listening actively. What’s required to listen actively is more difficult to learn than it was to learn to speak when we were young. It’s not something that can be absorbed through simply interacting with other humans. Active listening requires the receiver in the conversation to seek out among the speakers words and try to understand what the speaker is really saying. To fish through the emotion, defensiveness, cultural differences and jargon. \n\nIf it’s so hard to listen than it must be extremely hard to get some one to pay attention to what your saying\n\nOne of the most important elements of communication is creating effective feedback. Whether by picking up on non verbal cues or audible ones feedback is important. Knowing that your message is being understood correctly is vital. Feedback when done by the sender, allows the speaker a chance to make sure that the listener understands what is trying to be communicated. Someways to use feed back is through closed ended questions like  “do you understand what I’m saying?” or ” did that make sense?” Another effective tactic is using an open ended question and through this method the listener will hopefully summarize the message you have been trying to impart and in turn expose any misunderstandings between the two of you.  Using a question like “what do you think about what I’ve just told you?” or “what are your feelings on the subject?” are both effective examples of using a open ended question in order to obtain clarification between the sender and the receiver.\n\nIn the business world feedback is even more crucial. Feedback from your employees, your clients, and customers plays an important role in creating and maintaining a business or institution. Making sure that they understand what your trying to say whether it’s through management or advertising. It’s important to know that, not only is your message getting through, but that it’s being interpreted correctly. \n\nOnce you’ve gained an understanding of how your information is being perceived and interpreted. You’ll know how to proceed, cutting of those things feedback has shown to be ineffective and replacing it with solutions known to produce the results you want. \n\nMake sure that people understand what you are trying to say. Whether in marketing, management, or just everyday conversations. Through feedback, communication can be an effective tool in the world of business and everywhere else."},{title:"Advertising Outdoors",body:"To a general advertiser outdoor advertising is worthy of consideration. Outdoor advertising is considered as the oldest form of advertising. Posting bills on wooden boards in the late 19th century led to the birth of the term billboard. Today, outdoor advertising includes not only billboards but also car cards in public transportation, displays in airports, ski areas, and sports arenas and in-store displays among others. Consider this scenario: you were on your way to the office and without even looking at the morning paper you found out that your favorite boutique is opening in the neighborhood. Or you were on your way home from work when you find out that a major company you would love to work for is hiring – and this you knew without even having your own radio on. How did all these happen? Through outdoor advertising. \n\nOutdoor advertising is very powerful and effective. It has the ability to target consumers quickly and accurately. Likewise, it can create a strong visual impression that reinforces continuity and name recognition, making your overall marketing campaign even more effective. According to studies, more and more consumers are spending time than ever driving or riding in cars and walking in cities. This means that customers are exposed to outdoor advertising more than ever before. Hence, making use of outdoor advertising can significantly increase your chance of attracting more customers. Designing and creating an outdoor advertising is like creating a visual storytelling. The expression of an idea can surprise viewers with words or excite them with pictures. Humor is a powerful design choice for outdoor advertising. The character of outdoor advertising requires a clear message, a strong brand identity and a fast impact. Outdoor advertising shares many communication characteristics with other media, but it is the differences that truly determine what will be effective design elements for an advertisement.\n\nSo what could outdoor advertising do that traditional advertising can’t? Outdoor advertising has better advantage when it comes to a regional or national showing. And outdoor advertising can reinforce the primary message delivered through broadcast or print. Additionally, outdoor advertising requires low active processing because consumers receive its messages when they are in an inactive state of mind. Often, commuters sit idle in their vehicles when outdoor messages are presented so their mood is under stimulated. This is a good opportunity for advertisers because well-presented outdoor designs will grab attention when commuters are deprived of other creative stimulation. \n\nThus, keep in mind that impressive advertising is essential for the long-term success of any brand, since advertising works best when an individual consumer learns that a product or service is a good choice for them."},{title:"Advertising Internet Online Opportunities To Explore",body:"The collapse of the online-advertising market in 2001 made marketing on the Internet seem even less compelling.

There are several benefits to participating in a trade show. Some of them are:\n\nA trade show offers the manufacturer a direct platform to interact with the very people who will be making purchasing decisions. Most purchasing managers of corporations make it a point to attend trade shows relevant to their needs in order to evaluate a wide range of products and services, all under one roof. If offers them variety, at a fraction of the time regular meetings with sales personnel form all those companies ever could. If this is the reason why they visit trade shows, isn’t it obvious that your product or service needs to be showcased in the trade show as well?\n\nTwo, trade shows offer all manufacturers a level playing field. Of course it may not seem like this as some manufacturers have bigger spaces with far better stalls and displays, but at the heart of it all, a trade show is where conventional competitors come together to provide the end user with the best possible information to make a purchasing judgement.\n\nThree, trade shows provide manufacturers, especially relatively unknown ones, with a readymade audience that is focused, targeted and in the best frame of mind to make a purchasing decision. As far as targeted advertising goes, a trade show is by far the most effective way to reach the target audience.\n\nA trade show also allows for demonstrations. Conventional print advertising is not interactive and showing demonstrations on television could prove really expensive and not worth the investment. But in a trade show, a demonstrations is almost a pre-requisite. I still remember a heavy machinety trade show I had the opportunity to attend. On one hand, there was Ingersoll-Rand with their range of diggers, back hoes and dump trucks. On the other hand, there was caterpillar with their ‘Cat’ range of equipment. Elsewhere, Komatsu had lined up their state-of-the-art equipment. Being able to see all these equipment on display, performing actual tasks that they were created for gave not only me, but all other purchasing managers there an unforgettable demonstration. You can be sure that when the time to take a decision arrived, we had no problems in picking our personal preferences!\n\nBut not all trade shows are effective. It is a sad part of the competitive world we live I that several fly-by-night operators have entered the trade show industry. Out to make a quick buck, these unscrupulous operators try and organize events and trade shows that neither have a reputation, nor attract manufacturers with one. As a result, the gullible manufacturers who invest time, money and effort in these trade shows, lose a lot. The best way to stay clear of such operators is to stick with trade show organizers who have a proven track record, are reliable and provide you with measurable service. Online and offline organizations like the National Trade Productions and the Trade Show Exhibitors Association of America (www.tsea.org) offers several tips and guidelines on how you can get the maximum value from your investment in trade shows. By linking organizations and individuals involved with trade shows and the trade events businesses, these associations enable a connected trade show exhibitor’s world where each and every member can learn from the collective experience of all the members. Where applicable or necessary, local chapters also exist and provide the same services to exhibits on a local scale. You can never go wrong if you follow the simple guidelines these associations offer."

There are so many ways to decorate that it can easily be very overwhelming to find the right things that are in the right budget. As an interior designer, I am often meeting with clients who are overwhelmed with their options and who are having trouble staying within a budget. I often suggest art posters to these kinds of clients.\n\nArt posters is a surprising answer for many of my clients that come with questions. They are surprised because they have never thought about the great option that art posters can be. So I suggest art posters and then I show them the samples of art posters that I have all over my own home and office. There are a few main reasons why I suggest decorating with art posters.\n\nFirst, I love seeing people decorate with art posters because they are inexpensive. Not that you should always choose what is inexpensive for your home or office, but if you are anything like me, then your tastes and personal style are constantly changing. If this is the case, decorating with art posters is a great way to decorate for a time when you know that your tastes will change soon enough. So often people buy expensive pieces of beautiful art and then change their minds within a couple of years. Buying art posters is a great way to stay in a reasonable price range and to give yourself the freedom to explore new options for art later.\n\nAnother great thing about art posters is that they come in such a large variety. You can be looking for almost anything and find what you’re looking for in the form of an art poster. I love that. I love that a client can be looking for a beach scene or for art that looks like it came from Paris and they can usually find art posters representing what they like.\n\nIf you are trying to decorate and you think that art posters might be an option for you, then head to an art posters store and check out your options. It is a good idea to have some thoughts about what you’re looking for first. Try to know what style and colors you are looking for. The decision making process will be much easier if you know what kind of art posters to seek."},{title:"Get Best Advertiser In Your Side Pocket",body:"I have been questioned by many people to disclose some of the greatest traffic generating techniques that I know of.

My first and foremost form of traffic comes from the higher ranked pages. My link is on web’s most popular sites. You should be able to be part of those famous sites. Do not waste your time in submitting your link anywhere blindly. You must show up your creative work. Going for link partners just to gain a few ranks, is a hard work.\n\nAdvertising is key factor in your web site promotion. Let people talk about you, your products, and your services. You see, people are always on the look out for good content right? Your site should have really good contents. Don’t write “Welcome to my website” or “Ours is a World’s first company…blah blah” unless and until you really have dominating product.

Writing result-oriented ad copy is difficult, as it must appeal to, entice, and convince consumers to take action. There is no magic formula to write perfect ad copy; it is based on a number of factors, including ad placement, demographic, even the consumer’s mood when they see your ad. So how is any writer supposed to pen a stunning piece of advertising copy — copy that sizzles and sells? The following tips will jumpstart your creative thinking and help you write a better ad.\n\nKNOW THE BASICS\n\nAll good advertising copy is comprised of the same basic elements. Good advertising copy always:\n\nGrabs Attention: Consumers are inundated with ads, so it’s vital that your ad catches the eye and immediately grabs interest. You could do this with a headline or slogan (such as VW’s “Drivers Wanted” campaign), color or layout (Target’s new colorful, simple ads are a testimony to this) or illustration (such as the Red Bull characters or Zoloft’s depressed ball and his ladybug friend). Promises Credible Benefit: To feel compelled by an ad, the consumer must stand to gain something; the product is often not enough. What would the consumer gain by using your product or service? This could be tangible, like a free gift; prestige, power or fame. But remember: you must be able to make good on that promise, so don’t offer anything unreasonable.\n\nKeeps Interest: Grabbing the consumer’s attention isn’t enough; you have to keep that attention for at least a few seconds. This is where your benefits come into play or a product description that sets your offer apart from the others.\n\nGenerates Action: This is the ultimate point of advertising copy — it must make the reader react in some way. This doesn’t necessarily translate to buying the product immediately or using the service. Your ad could be a positioning tool to enable the reader to think about you in a certain light. Speak to your audience, or the audience you’d like to reach, and you’ll be surprised how frequently they come to you in the future.\n\nKNOW THE MEDIUM\n\nHow you write your advertising copy will be based on where you will place your ad. If it’s a billboard ad, you’ll need a super catchy headline and simple design due to the speed at which people will pass. Online ads are similar; consumers are so inundated with Internet advertising that your ad must be quick and catchy. Magazine advertising is the most versatile, but this is solely dependent on the size of your ad and how many other ads compete with yours. If you have a full page ad, feel free to experiment; more page space gives you more creative space. If the ad is tiny, you’ll need to keep things as simple as possible.\n\nKNOW THE STYLE\n\nAdvertising copy is a unique type of writing. Its point is to balance creativity and readability into something persuasive and entertaining. Keep the following points in mind when you write your copy:\n\nBe Succinct: There are few things more damaging to an ad campaign than messy wordiness. Use short sentences with as many familiar words as possible; save the thesaurus for a thesis or dissertation. Always make sure to use precise phrasing (why use five adjectives when one good action verb would do?); and eliminate any redundancies, such as “little tiny” or “annual payments of $XXX per year.”\n\nTalk To Your Audience, Not At Them: Though you are announcing the availability of a product or service, avoid being clinical or overly formal. Write as if you’re talking to your ideal customer; use a style they’d use, words they’d be familiar with, slang they’d probably know. But be absolutely certain that you’re using these terms and phrases correctly. A recent McDonald’s campaign attempted to reach a certain audience by using the phrase “I’d hit it” in reference to a cheeseburger, unaware that the phrase is almost always used as a sexual reference.\n\nAvoid Clich      "},{title:"Influencing The Influencer",body:"Marketers/advertisers usually focus their efforts on the people responsible for making the purchase. In many cases, this is an effective approach but in other cases it can make for a totally useless marketing campaign.\n\nVirgin Mobile took a more effective approach in marketing their cell phone service by focusing not on the people that would be making the actual purchase, but instead focusing on the influencers of the people making the purchase. To make this campaign work, Virgin developed a viral website called Parental Enlightenment Kit which offers many tips (often fairy funny ones) to convince their parents to purchase a Virgin Mobile phone for them. By enlisting the teenagers Virgin has multiplied the effectiveness of their marketing campaign for 3 reasons:\n\n1. The teenagers will continually mention the phone/service to their parents until they get it – Virgin’s campaign will continue to work long after the teenager has left the computer.\n\n2. This approach is exactly the type of thing that spreads virally. As teenagers tell their friends about it, it will increase exponentially in it’s effectiveness.\n\n3. They have targeted the most likely decision maker rather than the person responsible for the purchase.\n\nCompanies in other industries have take the same approach and achieved amazing results. For example, Pfizer targeted men with erectile disfunction (a more PC term for impotence) rather than the doctors who would actually prescribe the drug (Viagra) to treat it. You can take the same approach to market your product/service and reap tremendous rewards."},{title:"Adwords Keyword Research For Beginners",body:"Adwords Keyword research for beginners   When you embark on your first PPC journey, you need to keep a small number of keywords at first. Keyword lists that are thousands of words long should be left to the more experienced PPC marketer. Ideally, a beginner should use around 100 targeted keywords, anything more will probably prove too cumbersome for you to manipulate. If you can’t harness the power of large keyword campaigns, they will suck your bank accounts dry. There are some very simple free techniques that you can use to find targeted keys words with low competition. One process of finding low competition niche keywords utilizes Google and excel. More specifically you want to use Google’s keyword tool, just type this into Google, and it will appear in the search results.  Upon landing on the main Google keyword tool page, you will find a white box(field) where you want to enter your particular keyword(s). Enter one keyword for now to get an idea of how this works, and press enter. After pressing enter, you will be directed to a page of keywords that will be closely related to the keyword that you entered. For the purposes of what we want to do, you will need to scroll to the middle of the page where the text Add all 150 is highlighted in blue bold text. Below these words you will see the words download all keywords with text,.csv(for excel) and .csv. You want to click on .csv(for excel). By doing this, you will export this data into an excel spreadsheet. The data, which only appears as green bars on the main Google page, will be transformed into numeric data that has much more value for you.   Once the data is in the excel spread sheet, you can begin some simple analysis on it that will benefit your PPC campaign a great deal. In the excel spreadsheet, there are going to be columns of data, A-D. The columns are going to be, from A-D, Keywords, Advertiser competition, the previous month’s search volume, and the average search volume.The two columns we are interested in are the advertiser competition and the Average search volume. What we want to do is merge the data from these two columns to give us a number that we can work with. So what we need to do is take a generalized average of these two to get a number which we will compare to a predetermined benchmark. Sounds a little odd, let me explain a bit more completely, and hopefully you will understand. All of these numbers are in decimals on a scale ranging from .00 to 1. The higher the number, the more competition there is(as expressed by the advertiser competition numbers) and the higher the search volume(as expressed by the average search volume). Ideally, we want low competition with a decent search volume to target lower cost high converting keywords. So, to find these keywords we use a general benchmark number that will determine their competition and volume level. If the keywords exceed the benchmark, we leave them be, if they hit right around the benchmark, or fall below it, we want to capture them and include them in our PPC campaign.   To get our figures, which we are going to compare to a predetermined benchmark, we are going to take an average of the advertiser competition column and the average search volume column. We want to do this for all the keywords that have been exported to the excel file. And the way we do this is by typing in a simple command in excel and copying the command down throughout the related boxes. So to start, we find box E2 which should be blank, this is the first box to the right of the first value in the avg. search volume box. So, within this blank box you want to type=average(D2,B2). This will automatically give you an average of those two numbers in this E column row when you close that last ).Now, to get all the averages for every keyword you simply want to click on that box(E2) and pull down on the box while you hold in right click. The boxes should fill in with color when you drag down to the last box(nothing will be in them yet). Then, when you have filled in the boxes with color up to the last box you want to lift your finger off the right click. When you do this all the averages will appear in the boxes. You basically just copied the function down through the boxes. So now we have all these averages. What do we do with them, what do they tell us?  Well, a good benchmark average is around .50. This will give us a reasonable competition level with good search volume. So we compare these averages to anything that falls around .50 and below. Anything that goes above .60 we want to avoid to start out with, because it will probably be too expensive to bid on. So now compare all the averages in column E to the predetermined benchmark of .50. Whatever falls below .50 or, .55(to possibly get some more data) we want to keep. Take all the keywords that meet this criteria and copy them into a notepad .txt file. (There are faster ways to do this but they take some learning of excel functions that you may not know yet.)  So now we want to take these keywords that fell below or right around the benchmark and plug these back into the Google keyword tool and hit enter. Now go back through the entire process that we just did to get the keywords we just plugged into the Google keyword tool. You are going to want to take the average again of the two columns mentioned above, then get all the averages of all the keywords by draggin the first box down, and then compare again to a benchmark of .50 or .55. But now, because we found some more targeted keywords to work with(as a result of the first exporting of data to excel, and taking the averages to compare against the benchmark) we should have more keywords that hit right around the benchmark and below it. This is because we are working with more targeted and hopefully lower competition keywords. We are finding yet more targeted keywords related to the first set we found. This should produce a larger list of keywords that meet our benchmark. So now we can take the words that meet the benchmark here, and we can use these in our targeted PPC campaign. You will want to sort through this list of course, and make sure the keywords are well suited for the particular items that you are selling. This method will get you headed in the right direction for your PPC campaign."},{title:"Write On Your Business Card",body:"Like the majority of sales people, I visit a huge number of clients and prospects every month, some end up buying some do not, but every single one of them has my business card. I attend business breakfasts, seminars and other networking event in my search for new contacts and ultimately new business, each person I meet also gets a business card. One day a few years ago I realised that I not only hand out a huge number of cards, but I also receive a fair few myself. I decided to go back through some of the older ones to see if I could find some new prospects. As I started to sift through them I began to realise that most peoples cards are actually meaningless in isolation. Unless you work for one of the few companies who’s name actually reflects what you do, you may as well be writing your telephone number on a piece of paper and forgetting to add your name. ABC Company\n\nMr Bob Jones\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nTelephone number\n\nMobile number\n\nFax number\n\nEmail address\n\nWebsite\n\nWithout going online and looking at every single website I have no idea what the companies do!\n\nLikewise, all those people I had been diligently handing my business card too had every conceivable method of contacting me, written there in black and white, but no idea what I do! It’s my job as a sales person to “put my face about”, make sure I am always contactable and remember as much as I can about all my prospects (with perhaps, a little help from my CRM). My prospects are also everyone else’s prospects, they do not need to remember me, and so they need a little help.\n\nI realised the solution is simple. WRITE ON YOUR BUSINESS CARDS!!! Here’s the scenario: The prospect gets back to the office one day and is told they need a new supplier for widgets, it’s his job to find one. He remembers speaking to a few suppliers at the seminar but can’t remember exactly who, so he quickly flips through the cards collected, then, he comes across one, he can’t remember the name or the face to match it, but, in nice clear writing it says “Widgets, budget to high end” Who gets invited in for a meeting?\n\nI’m one of those people who guard my business cards at meetings. I don’t like meaningless cardboard connections (exchanging business cards without a purpose). I’m put off by someone who says, “Hello, my name is…. Here is my business card, can I have yours?” My suspicion is that I’m going to be put on someone’s junk mail list. However, by first striking a chord, you’ve accomplished something very important in your networking mission — you’ve found a reason to extend the relationship beyond the event at which you met.\n\nNot all prospects you meet are going to fit your ideal client (or center of influence) profile. This is especially true for me, since I have a highly specialized niche. Focus your attention on those who meet your criteria. Jot down notes on the back of the card (the reason for the solid connection), and then you’ll have a conversation point in which to build your relationship at the next meeting or in your correspondence. Follow up quickly after the meeting by sending information you promised.\n\nThe Term “cardboard connection” was coined by Anne Baber and Lynne Waymon authors of “Make Your Contacts Count” www.ContactsCount.com"},{title:"Internet Advertising Trends You Won T Be Disappointed",body:"I hate peeping Toms.

Good advertising copy always:\n\nGrabs Attention: Consumers are inundated with ads, so it’s vital that your ad catches the eye and immediately grabs interest. You could do this with a headline or slogan (such as VW’s “Drivers Wanted” campaign), color or layout (Target’s new colorful, simple ads are a testimony to this) or illustration (such as the Red Bull characters or Zoloft’s depressed ball and his ladybug friend). Promises Credible Benefit: To feel compelled by an ad, the consumer must stand to gain something; the product is often not enough. What would the consumer gain by using your product or service? This could be tangible, like a free gift; prestige, power or fame. But remember: you must be able to make good on that promise, so don’t offer anything unreasonable.\n\nKeeps Interest: Grabbing the consumer’s attention isn’t enough; you have to keep that attention for at least a few seconds. This is where your benefits come into play or a product description that sets your offer apart from the others.\n\nGenerates Action: This is the ultimate point of advertising copy — it must make the reader react in some way. This doesn’t necessarily translate to buying the product immediately or using the service. Your ad could be a positioning tool to enable the reader to think about you in a certain light. Speak to your audience, or the audience you’d like to reach, and you’ll be surprised how frequently they come to you in the future.\n\nKNOW THE MEDIUM\n\nHow you write your advertising copy will be based on where you will place your ad. If it’s a billboard ad, you’ll need a super catchy headline and simple design due to the speed at which people will pass. Online ads are similar; consumers are so inundated with Internet advertising that your ad must be quick and catchy. Magazine advertising is the most versatile, but this is solely dependent on the size of your ad and how many other ads compete with yours. If you have a full page ad, feel free to experiment; more page space gives you more creative space. If the ad is tiny, you’ll need to keep things as simple as possible.\n\nKNOW THE STYLE\n\nAdvertising copy is a unique type of writing. Its point is to balance creativity and readability into something persuasive and entertaining. Keep the following points in mind when you write your copy:\n\nBe Succinct: There are few things more damaging to an ad campaign than messy wordiness. Use short sentences with as many familiar words as possible; save the thesaurus for a thesis or dissertation. Always make sure to use precise phrasing (why use five adjectives when one good action verb would do?); and eliminate any redundancies, such as “little tiny” or “annual payments of $XXX per year.”\n\nTalk To Your Audience, Not At Them: Though you are announcing the availability of a product or service, avoid being clinical or overly formal. Write as if you’re talking to your ideal customer; use a style they’d use, words they’d be familiar with, slang they’d probably know. But be absolutely certain that you’re using these terms and phrases correctly. A recent McDonald’s campaign attempted to reach a certain audience by using the phrase “I’d hit it” in reference to a cheeseburger, unaware that the phrase is almost always used as a sexual reference.\n\nAvoid Clich      "
},{title:"Influencing The Influencer",body:"Marketers/advertisers usually focus their efforts on the people responsible for making the purchase. In many cases, this is an effective approach but in other cases it can make for a totally useless marketing campaign.\n\nVirgin Mobile took a more effective approach in marketing their cell phone service by focusing not on the people that would be making the actual purchase, but instead focusing on the influencers of the people making the purchase. To make this campaign work, Virgin developed a viral website called Parental Enlightenment Kit which offers many tips (often fairy funny ones) to convince their parents to purchase a Virgin Mobile phone for them. By enlisting the teenagers Virgin has multiplied the effectiveness of their marketing campaign for 3 reasons:\n\n1. The teenagers will continually mention the phone/service to their parents until they get it – Virgin’s campaign will continue to work long after the teenager has left the computer.\n\n2. This approach is exactly the type of thing that spreads virally. As teenagers tell their friends about it, it will increase exponentially in it’s effectiveness.\n\n3. They have targeted the most likely decision maker rather than the person responsible for the purchase.\n\nCompanies in other industries have take the same approach and achieved amazing results. For example, Pfizer targeted men with erectile disfunction (a more PC term for impotence) rather than the doctors who would actually prescribe the drug (Viagra) to treat it. You can take the same approach to market your product/service and reap tremendous rewards."},{title:"Adwords Keyword Research For Beginners",body:"Adwords Keyword research for beginners   When you embark on your first PPC journey, you need to keep a small number of keywords at first. Keyword lists that are thousands of words long should be left to the more experienced PPC marketer. Ideally, a beginner should use around 100 targeted keywords, anything more will probably prove too cumbersome for you to manipulate. If you can’t harness the power of large keyword campaigns, they will suck your bank accounts dry. There are some very simple free techniques that you can use to find targeted keys words with low competition. One process of finding low competition niche keywords utilizes Google and excel. More specifically you want to use Google’s keyword tool, just type this into Google, and it will appear in the search results.  Upon landing on the main Google keyword tool page, you will find a white box(field) where you want to enter your particular keyword(s). Enter one keyword for now to get an idea of how this works, and press enter. After pressing enter, you will be directed to a page of keywords that will be closely related to the keyword that you entered. For the purposes of what we want to do, you will need to scroll to the middle of the page where the text Add all 150 is highlighted in blue bold text. Below these words you will see the words download all keywords with text,.csv(for excel) and .csv. You want to click on .csv(for excel). By doing this, you will export this data into an excel spreadsheet. The data, which only appears as green bars on the main Google page, will be transformed into numeric data that has much more value for you.   Once the data is in the excel spread sheet, you can begin some simple analysis on it that will benefit your PPC campaign a great deal. In the excel spreadsheet, there are going to be columns of data, A-D. The columns are going to be, from A-D, Keywords, Advertiser competition, the previous month’s search volume, and the average search volume.The two columns we are interested in are the advertiser competition and the Average search volume. What we want to do is merge the data from these two columns to give us a number that we can work with. So what we need to do is take a generalized average of these two to get a number which we will compare to a predetermined benchmark. Sounds a little odd, let me explain a bit more completely, and hopefully you will understand. All of these numbers are in decimals on a scale ranging from .00 to 1. The higher the number, the more competition there is(as expressed by the advertiser competition numbers) and the higher the search volume(as expressed by the average search volume). Ideally, we want low competition with a decent search volume to target lower cost high converting keywords. So, to find these keywords we use a general benchmark number that will determine their competition and volume level. If the keywords exceed the benchmark, we leave them be, if they hit right around the benchmark, or fall below it, we want to capture them and include them in our PPC campaign.   To get our figures, which we are going to compare to a predetermined benchmark, we are going to take an average of the advertiser competition column and the average search volume column. We want to do this for all the keywords that have been exported to the excel file. And the way we do this is by typing in a simple command in excel and copying the command down throughout the related boxes. So to start, we find box E2 which should be blank, this is the first box to the right of the first value in the avg. search volume box. So, within this blank box you want to type=average(D2,B2). This will automatically give you an average of those two numbers in this E column row when you close that last ).Now, to get all the averages for every keyword you simply want to click on that box(E2) and pull down on the box while you hold in right click. The boxes should fill in with color when you drag down to the last box(nothing will be in them yet). Then, when you have filled in the boxes with color up to the last box you want to lift your finger off the right click. When you do this all the averages will appear in the boxes. You basically just copied the function down through the boxes. So now we have all these averages. What do we do with them, what do they tell us?  Well, a good benchmark average is around .50. This will give us a reasonable competition level with good search volume. So we compare these averages to anything that falls around .50 and below. Anything that goes above .60 we want to avoid to start out with, because it will probably be too expensive to bid on. So now compare all the averages in column E to the predetermined benchmark of .50. Whatever falls below .50 or, .55(to possibly get some more data) we want to keep. Take all the keywords that meet this criteria and copy them into a notepad .txt file. (There are faster ways to do this but they take some learning of excel functions that you may not know yet.)  So now we want to take these keywords that fell below or right around the benchmark and plug these back into the Google keyword tool and hit enter. Now go back through the entire process that we just did to get the keywords we just plugged into the Google keyword tool. You are going to want to take the average again of the two columns mentioned above, then get all the averages of all the keywords by draggin the first box down, and then compare again to a benchmark of .50 or .55. But now, because we found some more targeted keywords to work with(as a result of the first exporting of data to excel, and taking the averages to compare against the benchmark) we should have more keywords that hit right around the benchmark and below it. This is because we are working with more targeted and hopefully lower competition keywords. We are finding yet more targeted keywords related to the first set we found. This should produce a larger list of keywords that meet our benchmark. So now we can take the words that meet the benchmark here, and we can use these in our targeted PPC campaign. You will want to sort through this list of course, and make sure the keywords are well suited for the particular items that you are selling. This method will get you headed in the right direction for your PPC campaign."},{title:"Freelance Design Tricks How To Get Away With Murder In The Workplace",body:"Every large design company whether it’s a multi-national branding corporation or a regular down at heel tatty magazine publisher needs to fill holes in the workforce. If the canny freelance designer plays his or her cards right, he can earn a tidy sum while essentially loafing at home. Here’s how…\n\nHave a handy repotoire of excuses lined up\n\nEveryone has heard of the line ‘the dog ate it…’ or ‘I left it in my jeans when it went into the wash’ to avoid handing in an assignment but how often do we actually use them? Some of these old well worn excuses are due for a renaissance period. A boss is far more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt when you use one of these old dogs as they will question your sanity for attempting to use such an audacious excuse. Reverse psychology. Use it to your advantage\n\nBackstabbing – Is it so wrong?\n\nA favourite trick to pull on another member of staff is to sow the seeds of doubt in the rest of the full-timers minds about your chosen fall guy. Office politics can play a huge role in screwing with their heads. Why not try surreptiously planting somebody elses scissors or staplers in the victims drawer and asking to borrow them. When they can’t find them say you saw so and so using them earlier. Sit back and watch the tension build.\n\nAn apple a day…\n\nBeing a teachers pet can sometimes work wonders when you haven’t bothered to layout those pages that were given to you 3 weeks ago. Coming into the office armed with a nice rich chocolate gateau for everyone will smooth over any resentment for your tarde lackadaisacal attitude to work. Another good idea is to be the coffee gopher at regular half hour intervals. When you’re gone they’ll really miss you and because of the caffeine withdrawal will be snapping at one another.\n\nOutsource and reap the rewards\n\nEverybodies doing it so why not you? If you’ve landed a hefty long term design job that is a regular payer, why not bump your rates up and get somebody in India or China to knock out the work for you. Unethical? Perhaps but since when did you consider the plight of individuals in far flung places? You can explain away the discrepances in language and grammar by claiming you’ve been working all hours\n\nGetting away with murder\n\nThere comes a time and place when despite your best efforts to cover your ass and blame others for your laziness and ineptitude, you are going to be found out. At this stage with disgruntled colleagues lining up to put in a bad word about you, there may be no other option left but to use the failsafe rear guard action of killing someone. This will have the effect of distracting attention from your less than honest approach to handing in graphic designs on time. It’s probably best to avoid murdering the boss as questions are likely to be raised and you may find the new apointed editor will not see you as part of the new team format. No, go for one of the more replacable members of staff such as Ian the sub-editor, the resulting fracas will buy you enough time to work on some new scams at another organisation\n\nSo there you go, use these tricks as and when you feel they may benefit you. But be careful the cops are sometimes pretty keen to clamp down on office genocide – only use this last option under extreme duress."},{title:"A Good Autoresponder",body:"How many free autoresponders have you tried? Really how many? And how many emails did you get through using them? How do you know? How many people opened your followup message?\n\nMy point here is that if you have no clue for the answers above you probably are not operating a followup campaign successfully. These are crucial element that must be explored when you are choosing an autoresponder.\n\nSome good steps to take to ensure you are getting what you need out of a autoresponder include… Compare your autoresponder with those of top marketers, chances are they are using the best in the business. You can’t go wrong with this step!\n\nOther observations you might make are related to spam filters. Have you ever gotten an e-mail and seen something like this…”F`R`E`E” Yes this is a good way to beat the spam filters as they won’t read Free they will read something totally different. However it can be time consuming going through your article and finding which words are “Danger” words. This can go along way in your marketing efforts. So make sure you find an autoresponder that has a spam rating feature… these features will automatically show you where in your article your “Danger” words are.\n\nAnother crucial element of e-mail marketing are your statistics. How many e-mails are being opened can tell you if your subject line is any good or if you did a good job branding your name. If you know your e-mail statistics you are one step in the right direction in optimizing your potential sales. Finding an autoresponder that shows in depth analysis with your followups are also key.\n\nWhat should a followup contain? Good question… My personally experience suggests directing your subscribers to a full article located on the web. There are some good reasons for this. You can create an excitement teaser in the followup e-mail and beg your article to be read on the web. There is also the chance that since you have an article archive on the web many subscribers will often read more than just your original article. Your subscriber might not be interested in one article but they may find what they are looking for browsing through your previous articles.\n\nBroadcasting! So your subscribers are finished receiving their original followup series… now what? Find an auto responder that allows you to broadcast an update or an offer to the entire subscriber list. Don’t let your subscribers go to waste, this feature is a must!\n\nRemember not to bore your hard earned subscribers. Present them with a problem and offer them a solution! Its that easy…\n\nFind my recommended autoresponder on my marketing blog!"},{title:"The 3 Golden Rules Professional Graphic Designers Don T Want You To Know About",body:"Ever wondered how some graphic designers always manage to produce beautiful looking designs for their brochures, website designs, logo designs? Talent…yes, it helps but there are a handful of more important things you can do that will have even complete beginners producing award winning design.\n\nForget everything you’ve ever been told about Graphic Design\n\nThere are some hard and fast things that graphic designers will insist are to be obeyed. Only use limited fonts on a design for example or never use green on a magazine or book cover as people will not buy it. Stuff and nonsense. You can pretty much do whatever you like but you must apply these STRICT GRAPHIC DESIGN RULES and you will soon be walking away with graphic design silverware.\n\nSomewhere on the page you MUST put in a subliminal message\n\nThis can be done in a multitude of ways for example if you are producing a brochure selling wellington boots then start every paragraph spelling out ‘buy our wellington boots’ or better still ‘you have no choice but to buy our wellington boots now get out your cheque book and buy them – NOW!’ Another crafty method is to doctor images in photoshop so that on an innocent picture of a tree for example carved into the bark is a message along the lines of ‘U Luv Wellington boots’ You get the idea. just make sure it’s hidden away on a subliminal level and watch your sales go through the roof, quite literally\n\nYou MUST include a picture of a pretty girl smiling on your document or webpage\n\nThis works for 95% of products. Put simply would you rather read and look at pictures of industrial machinery or would you rather look at a pretty girl? It’s a no brainer right? Research has proven that mens brains are wired up to focus on girls smiles and of course their breasts and backsides. If you can somehow convince your client to put a naked girl on there somewhere you can pretty much laugh yourself down to the bank. However, never ever put a muscle bound hunk on any design thinking it will work conversely for womens products. Research has shown that womens brains are only wired to think of shopping for clothes and chocolate, so putting a bare chested chippendale on the cover is going to see your business go down the dumper. Unless your product is for homosexual merchandise in which case go ahead.\n\nShock and Awe – the guaranteed way to get your design work noticed and talked about\n\nPerhaps the best example of this trick can be found widely used in the modern art world. Sharks in formaldahyde, unmade beds and plastic dolls melted together to sodomise each other. All these pieces of art have been much talked about and whether you find them to your taste or not are widely percieved as being breath takingly original. The same principal can and should be applied to your graphic design work or website design. Add a blood splattered severed willy in the centre of the page for example or how about using an excrement smear as a backdrop. Remember the important thing is to get people talking about your design work. Bad taste soon becomes acceptable once commonplace so be the first to do something outrageous and reap the rewards.\n\nIf you remember to apply at least one or two and ideally all 3 of these golden graphic design rules there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be a millionaire/billionaire within one or two months. Now get creative!"},{title:"Research In Advertising",body:"Research in advertising is done in order to produce better advertisements that are more efficient in motivating customers to buy a product or a service. The research can be based on a particular advertising campaign or can be more generalized and based on how advertisements create an effect on people’s mind. Lots of approaches are involved to go about conducting an advertising research like economical, psychological, demographical and sociological. \n\nWhen designing an advertisement for a particular product many things should be researched like where it should be displayed, whether the advertisement can be printed in newspapers or magazines or broadcasted on television or radio or published on the Internet. Many methods are undertaken to collect relevant information. The research itself is of two kinds, syndicated and customized. Syndicated research is a single research done by the company that is available to other companies as well. Customized research is research based on certain criteria and is done for a particular company and its results are available to only that company. Pre-testing or copy testing is a type of customized research that determines the in-market efficiency of an advertisement before it is released or before the final production. The more the pre-testing is done the more likely that it will be a successful advertisement and each pre-testing should be applied number of times. This can done by studying the level of attention the customers have, motivation, brand linkage, communication and entertainment. Flow of emotions and flow of attention are broken down and studied individually. The results are applied on the advertisement that is still being developed to recognize the weak points and replace them. A reliable feedback loop can guide the researchers, client and the agency to work in harmony. Tests should be applied during the storyboard stage of ad making. This is an early stage and the results are highly predictive. During this process images are selected and used as integrated campaign print ad.\n\nPost-testing or ad tracking studies are either syndicated or customized. Studies are done over a period of time or continuously. The in-market research is done to understand a brands linkage, performance, awareness, and preference along with product attitudes and usage. They are done by, conducting interviews either on phone or Internet. Testing the finished advertisement provides the confidence and gives an idea whether it is following the strategy. All the above studies should facilitate the client’s advertisement development make the end product easier to achieve. The study should contain rational information having not only surface knowledge but also provide deep in-sight that will open window to a customer’s mind. The customer, too, should provide precise information based on facts and not based on imaginary thinking and self-delusion. He should be able to explain the role of advertisement in the whole marketing plan. Working in vacuum doesn’t get the desired result. \n\nThe basis is to provide in-depth understanding about the consumers for improving on the advertisement techniques and other marketing decisions. The traditional methods of qualitative and quantitative techniques have been improved to analyze the information with good insight. The rapidly changing likes and needs of the customers are difficult to track, but should be studied in order to increase the quality of advertisement. The changes are because of the huge number of options offered to them by the market."},{title:"Finally A Top Secret Way You Can Get Google Adwords Pay Per Clicks Free",body:"A gentleman from New York discovered what he calls an “oversight” on the part of 99.9% of all marketers that allows him to get otherwise paid-for advertising at Google as well as all other search engines that allow sponsored ads.\n\nAnd no, nothing about his “secret” is illegal – nor does it require that you know someone on the “inside” at Google, Yahoo, MSN, Overture and others.\n\nInstead, the New Yorker boasts proudly “…this is something that I caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around, and started doing small just to test things at first … but which I later expanded on after getting the hang of it.”\n\nThis same fellow went on to start and operate sixteen separate online companies selling everything from pet food, DVDs, children’s toys & games, books, software, and sold not only his own manufactured products but became an affiliate for other web businesses – all the while applying his mastermind secret.\n\nOver the course of nearly eight years the New Englander confesses “I’ve actually gotten over $87 million in advertising that using my secret I never had to pay for … and the largest share of which was more recently in Google pay-per-clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines … all of which I got for free …”\n\nSo powerful is his secret that he’s able to monopolize any niche online, and can always secure the top premium spots just above the usual organic results featured at most search engines.\n\nHe still has to set up an account with the search engines – but after applying his secret he is removed from having to pay for all the costs otherwise involved.\n\nAgain, nothing about his secret is either illegal or robs from the search engines.\n\nOne spokesperson from one of the most popular search engines said chuckling after being made privy to this amazing secret “Wow!

One of such options to cut the startup costs is a company logo design. But is it good idea to order a cheap logo or work without company logo at all?\n\nLogo represents company’s identity. First impression is made by logo or its absence. To know the importance of a logo just answer one question: “How many big, leading and famous companies don’t have logos?” If you company doesn’t have a logo this can raise doubts and negative thoughts. If logo was made by non-professional designer or made by owner of the company it is sometimes worse than no logo at all.\n\nOne of the popular questions is – why my logo should be custom? If logo is created with the use of a clipart (premade graphic elements from the public collections) it may look like or be identical to other logos and even your competitors’ logos. This will make identification of your company difficult or your logo may be easily mixed up with logo of another company. This situation may harm your reputation and money invested in marketing of your brand will be wasted. Good company logo reflects the main point of your company, its values and helps in successful development of the business. Also, it is important to distinguish the logo design for big companies and start-ups. Logo for the big company may consist only of a one graphic element (Nike swoosh) and it will be easily identifiable but for small company such logo is a bad idea because you will need to spent huge amounts of money to promote it.\n\nWhen owner of the company decides to create logo himself results are rarely look professional. Results of his work may serve as concept for a new logo but not as logo. To create a successful logo you need more than Photoshop and tutorial from the internet. You need to have knowledge of the basics of design at least; you need to have experience in logo design. Bad logo is worse than no logo.\n\nCompany logo is one of the must have attributes of the successful business. High-quality business card may tell a lot about its owner as well as a bad one. Let’s sum up. Logo should be custom and designed by a professional logo designer. You’ll never have a second chance to make a good first impression. You have just a few seconds to attract the attention and to make first impression. In many ways first impression depends on your logo. Successful marketing of your business starts with a successful corporate identity."},{title:"Differentiate Yourself And Attract More Attention Sales And Profits",body:"Differentiate and you stand out in a crowded marketplace. Present your uniqueness and emphasize your rare attributes in your sales copy and promotions and you’ll capture the imagination and interest of those you want to reach. In a world of copycats, it pays to be an original. It’s usually the creator of a new concept who gets the most mileage from it. Innovative entrepreneurs often become market leaders while competitors keep doing things the same old way – until change is forced upon them. Differentiate or die. Challenging the way things have always been done can lead to creative new options that reward you with a windfall of profits. Differentiate your business and you attract attention. It’s new, different – even revolutionary – and it’s the kind of thing that generates excitement and creates a stir in the market. After all, few new customers would be drawn to you — if you were doing the exact same thing, the exact same way as everyone else. Consider this question… “What Could You Do To Differentiate Yourself, Your Business, Or Your Product In A Way Prospects and Customers Would Appreciate?” Another thought to ponder is this… “What Traditions Could You Break That Would Capture Attention And Interest?” Putting an effective new spin on your business should be done with the needs and desires or your customers and prospects in mind. Differentiate from their point of view. What changes can you implement that would make customers say “Wow!”? Think in terms of what people want. Essentially, they want to be served better, faster and with more convenience. They want to be entertained. They want to solve problems with less effort. They want instant gratification. They want respect and to be treated as VIP’s (which customers are, of course). They want to do business with companies that care about them, their environment, and the world at large. Differentiate in a way that appeals to these desires. Look at every facet of your business and compare the way you do things to the way competitor does. Are you operating in a similar manner? How might you do things differently? What changes could you make in that area that your customers would truly appreciate and value? Differentiate and you gain a huge advantage. Re-invent your business operations and marketing materials as though you were the customer. Design everything from the customer’s point of view. Take “tradition” and turn it upside down. Recast your business. Make it more user-friendly and benefit-oriented. Blaze a new trail… even if it means re-inventing your entire industry. Let’s look at a few simple examples. Many retail stores have their cash registers right up front – near the entrance. Couldn’t that prime real estate be better used to display enticing new merchandise and lure in more customers? PJ’s Pet Centres does this well. They’ve cleverly placed a large cage of adorable puppies right outside the front entrance. Few people can walk by without a short visit… and many of those are drawn inside the store. Some entrepreneurial-minded restauranteurs do the same thing with their kitchens. Patrons find it interesting and entertaining to watch the chef expertly prepare a multitude of culinary delights. At the same time, most competing kitchens are at the back of the restaurant and out of the way, so no one ever sees inside. East Side Mario’s has done something unique to differentiate itself. They know that desserts are among the most profitable items any restaurant can offer. So they don’t employ the traditional dessert tray or standard menu. Instead, they present beautiful color slides of their delicious, mouth-watering creations in a View Master. A View Master is a small plastic toy — about the size of a camera – that you hold to your eyes and click to change the image shown. Who can resist viewing each one of their specialties? It’s a fun, novel way to unveil delicious treats. Everyone gets a chuckle out of it the first time around and I’d be willing to bet that more people buy dessert because of it. Take a close look at your business and industry. What is considered “standard practice”? How might business be done differently? How could you change things in a way that creates interest, desire, curiosity, and more sales? In a world of apples, it pays to be an orange.\n\nMore resources at www.makeyoursalessoar.com"},{title:"Direct Mail Advertising How I Made 47 325 In 30 Days By Mailing 2 200 Letters",body:"How do you create a direct mail advertising campaign that gets results? \n\nThe following tips on creating a direct mail advertising campaign have been street-tested and will bring you huge returns in a short period of time. \n\nIn Fact, these tips enabled me to generate over $47,000 in mortgage commissions in less than 30 days!

The brochure must grab a viewer’s attention and hold it long enough to deliver the pertinent information. How do you grab your customers’ attention with just a piece of paper? You could try by giving the viewer a paper cut, but that’s not the kind of attention you want, is it? Seriously though, with so many brochures out there, how do you stand out? The answer is quite simple. Make sure your brochure is professionally designed, written, and printed. Here are some tips to keep in mind when you hire a freelancer or agency to design your brochure: Text is the key. Anyone can write copy, but only a skilled copywriter can write easy-to-read, strong sentence structures that articulate your company’s message. Wouldn’t you rather go to a specialist? Question all. No matter who is writing your copy, make sure the headline on the front of the brochure is in the form of a question. This question should make the viewer want to open the brochure to learn more. Focus on a problem that is most common in your target industry then tie it directly to a solution you provide your clients. Color matters. Stay in tune with your corporate colors. This will help keep an overall brand image in tact as well as strengthen the brand. Type Issues. Typography should be relevant and thought out. Type is so strong that it can make or break a brochure. Stay away from typical fonts and try to stand out from other brochures in your field. Picture This. If you do not need pictures to articulate a message, then do not use them. Most of the time people are prone to use so many pictures in a brochure, they don’t realize they are clouding their message and making their brochure ineffective. Pictures are great, especially when relevant, but they draw reader’s eyes away from the copy which you have spent so much time perfecting. So, use pictures with taste and if at all possible, don’t use them at all.\n\nIf you try to cut corners on your brochure you will end up spending more money down the road when you have to get it redesigned. Make sure you do it right the first time, and you will have a brochure that helps you make the biggest return on the investment."},{title:"Free Classifieds Using Them To Promote Your Stuff Online",body:"Classified advertising is a form of advertising that is particularly common in newspapers and other periodicals. A classified is usually textually based and can consist of as little as the type of item being sold, and a contact number to call for more information. It can also have much more detail, such as name to contact, address to contact or visit, a detailed description of the product or products. There are generally no pictures or other graphics within the advertisement, although sometimes a logo may be used. Classified advertising is generally grouped within the publication under headings classifying the product or service being offered, for example: Accounting, Automobiles, Clothing, Farm Produce, For Sale, For Rent, etc. Classified advertising is different from display advertising that often contains graphics or other art work and which is more typically distributed throughout a publication adjacent to editorial content.  The free classifieds are part of free classified advertising. The free classified advertising is the advertising free of cost. In recent times classified advertising or classified ads are not merely confined to print media, rather expanded to internet network. The free classifieds and free classified advertising have become hot online catchwords. Craigslist was one of the first online classified sites. The free Internet classified advertising is rapidly growing trend of recent times. There are numerous companies and websites that offer the free online classified ads. These websites receives free classifieds ads and advertise them free of cost.\n\nThere are also country specific classified online sites like usfreeads.com for United States. There are a number of agencies throughout the world that have made a business out of the classified advertising industry. For example: Wide Area Classifieds has created their own classified networks in which businesses and individuals can place ads in hundreds of different papers across the country.\n\nAccording to market researcher Classified Intelligence, in 2003, the market for classified ads in the United States was $15.9 billion (newspapers), $14.1 billion (online). The worldwide market for classified ads in 2003 was estimated at over $100 billion."},{title:"Profiles Of The Powerful Advertising Exec Steve Grasse",body:"After ten minutes with Ed Tettemer in the offices of the agency he founded with partner, Steve Red, you begin to understand the agency’s passion for excellence. After an hour with Ed, you begin to understand the intensity of his personal passion. You begin to understand it but I have a feeling that, even after days and days of exposure to him, you probably wouldn’t get the whole picture.\n\n“Passion,” the word, may seem descriptive of a complicated set of feelings and opinions. Oddly, in thinking about Ed Tettemer’s passion for his agency and its clients, it seems rather simple. It’s just that he wants everything to be excellent: excellent clients, excellent co-workers, excellent marketing solutions, excellent creative executions, excellent everything.\n\n“Where’d you go to college, Ed?” (A question most interviewers ask without expecting surprises in the response.) “Never went to college. Dropped out of high school and never looked back. Got my college degree at the Elkman agency and my graduate degree at Earle Palmer Brown.”\n\nMaybe it’s best to start at the beginning. Ed was born and raised and was “scared of the city,” living in a rather parochial environment. His Father was a sheriff in Bucks County and his Mother worked as a secretary in the office of the small township where they lived. Theirs was a simple life, a good life in a small town atmosphere. He and his Dad fished a lot and they ate what they caught. The vegetables on their table came from their garden except for the mushrooms they harvested after heavy rains. It seemed to be an uncomplicated existence far from the pressures and tensions of traditional business, especially the advertising business.\n\nDad was pretty much occupied with his job and the politics of the community. Mom was more influential on the lives of Ed and his older brother. Neither parent made strong suggestions about what Ed and his brother did to prepare them for a career. They were good people and Mom, especially, influenced the way Ed has turned out. She was passionate about music and books. Ed is, too. She preached, “Keep your eyes and ears open.” Ed tries to do that. All she wanted for her children was for them to be happy and she didn’t try to control their every move. Today, Ed appreciates that.\n\nHis childhood was a happy one. He liked to fish. He played a lot of baseball. He was a fairly typical American kid. Then, when he was in high school, there was a dramatic change. It was called the Viet Nam War. Consistent with how many people felt at the time, his older brother took off for Canada to resist the war. That had severe, negative impact on life in peaceful Bucks County. Overnight, the Tettemer family became pariahs. Friends deserted them. The community changed its view of them. Church changed. Bad stuff!\n\nClearly, that situation had a powerful influence on Ed’s psyche. He dropped out of high school and spent over three years hitch hiking all over the country. He found ways to make enough money to do a lot of both savory and unsavory things. He was a confused young man wandering the country during confusing times.\n\nBut he never lost touch with his Mother and Dad so, ultimately, he went home to Bucks County and found a job working as a glorified gopher for the Doylestown Intelligencer. He ran ads back and forth from the paper to its small, retail advertisers. He says, “I guess I was a junior account executive and didn’t know it.” He delivered ad proofs, started helping small stores with their ad copy and quickly learned how those small retailers did their newspaper advertising. During the year at the paper, he got to know and got to be friendly with many of his customers. He realized that most of them didn’t have a lot of confidence in the help they were getting from the paper. He believed that he could help them do better advertising, advertising that actually worked and could be tracked. He doesn’t know why he believed that but he believed it.\n\nHe remembered Pete’s Place in a rather nostalgic way. Pete’s Place was a restaurant in Ottsville just north of Doylestown. Their ad always ran on the same page with other restaurants. All of the ads were the same size, were laid out in a conventional rectangle and had many of the same messages: good food, low prices, family atmosphere, etc.\n\nPete’s Place was pretty much the same as a lot of places in that part of the country.\n\nExcept for one thing. Their logo and sign was a big wagon wheel. After Ed convinced them to try to look different, their next ad was designed to be round. It stood out nicely on the page with all the rectangles. Someone once said that good advertising should zig when the competition’s zags. While Ed didn’t refer to that specific quote during our interview, much of what he said about Pete’s Place and about Red Tettemer’s work seems to support that “Zig if they Zag”idea. Ed reflects, “I think I made six bucks on the work I did for Pete’s.” The result? He worked with mostly small retailers for four years and developed a keen understanding of how the retailer thinks and of what it takes to motivate consumers to respond to advertising and promotion. In his own words, “I guess I didn’t really know what I was doing but I liked my clients, worked hard and made a decent living.”\n\nMarriage followed as did a move into Center City where he, wife Lyn and daughter Jessie still live. His first job in the city was with the old Elkman Agency where he claims to have started “Knowing nothing.” His boss, Creative Director Jim Block, promised to make him into a copy writer and further promised that he would like doing it. Jim did what he promised and Ed did like it. He had five productive years there but was always the junior writer. He needed more.\n\nOff to Becker/Kanter (now Panzano & Partners,) he soon learned the logic of focusing on vertical businesses. He was a senior creative director there working almost exclusively on shopping center advertising and promotion. The “vertical” idea had great influence on him in the early days of Red Tettemer when they spent most of their effort with cable TV and entertainment accounts.\n\nHe was recruited to Earle Palmer Brown where three factors influenced his thinking and his behavior. First, Brian Meridith, then the head of creative at EPB, showed him how important it was to have a good idea at the beginning of creative execution. “What’s the idea? What’s the idea?” was hammered into his consciousness. Second, he formed a new perspective about “vertical.” While it’s valuable and, at times, necessary, to focus on specific industries, it’s also valuable and stimulating to have a broader base. Today’s Red Tettemer is definitely broad based and probably always will be.\n\nThe third factor was, perhaps, the most important. In early 1992, Ed just didn’t know what to do with his career and his growing, positive reputation. “I was disillusioned.\n\nI just didn’t believe in the people I worked for.” Fortunately, he was allowed to do some free lance work and frequently collaborated with Steve Red with whom he had a marvelous working relationship. He got a call from Steve about working with him on several large assignments. His copy, Steve’s design skills and their ability to work together so effectively brought out his assertion, “I had the time of my life working with Steve.”\n\nIt took Ed three years to convince Steve to join with him to form Red Tettemer in 1996.\n\nThey live by their mission statement, “Energize our clients and their businesses.” Ed is proud when he reports that they try hard to make their clients’ competitors envious. They’ve followed those convictions while moving from “vertical” client groups into more general accounts. Some of their recent acquisitions are SEPTA, University of Pennsylvania Health System and Hatfield Meats.\n\nNeither Ed nor Steve has much tolerance for the traditional approach used by many agencies. So, they’ve successfully created a fun environment. Their office space is designed in creative ways.

And one of the most effective ways to optimize your trade show display and increase traffic to your booth is through the use of banner stands. A banner stand for your trade show display draws attention to your booth and helps you deliver your message to prospective clients, current customers and business contacts at what is usually a highly competitive event. Your trade show display should stand out from the crowd, and a banner stand is a great way to make sure it does.\n\nBanners themselves are typically constructed with either fabric or vinyl. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of material, so you should consider how you will use your banner stand before deciding between fabric and vinyl. Fabric banners are durable and long-lasting. Fabric doesn’t reflect light like vinyl, which can decrease your banner’s readability. Fabric banners also don’t bend or crease so they travel well. However, fabric banners are not easy to clean and can become dingy or faded with time. Vinyl banners are easy to wipe clean and allow for brighter colors and sharper image definition on them making them more eye-catching than fabric banners. There are many aspects of banner stands that make your investment in one worthwhile. Banner stands can be designed with your company logo or graphics, and include the important information you want to convey to prospective clients. They can be used in conjunction with a trade show display or on their own to advertise a product, announce an event, or showcase information about your business. They can be used as an extension of your trade show booth at a show because they can be set up in other areas like the show lobby or at the end of an aisle. Additionally, banner stands are lightweight, portable, and easy to set up and take down.\n\nOnce you have invested in a banner stand, you will find many uses for this vital piece of equipment outside of trade show displays. Banner stands are reusable and long-lasting. You might consider setting up your custom banner stand in a shopping mall to draw customers into your store, in a hotel lobby to direct the flow of traffic, at a movie theater to advertise an upcoming film, at a sporting event to showcase team information, or wherever your audience is likely to be found. The benefits of a custom banner stand will last your business far beyond trade show displays, and with proper care can be used for several years of succinct, eye-catching advertisement for your business or company."},{title:"Search Engine Optimization And Advertising",body:"In today’s net-savvy world it has become common for any business to have a website which they use mostly for advertising their products and services. With the advent of search engines it has become even easier for the customers to search for the stuff online. For a website to be successful its link should land in the first three pages which the search engine brings and the rank of the page should be high which means many visitors come to the site. This can be achieved by applying search engine optimization or popularly known as SEO. This is a marketing strategy which increases the quality and quantity of traffic flow to a particular website via search engines. SEO not only affects the search engine results, but also image search, video search and industry specific vertical search engines. It determines how a search algorithm functions and searches what is popular with people. When a website link is submitted to a search engine, a spider crawls through a page to gather links which lead to other pages and stores those pages on the server of the search engine. The information collected from these pages is sent to the indexer, whose job is to extract information from those pages such as the keywords and their weights, the location of the page and other links that are stored for the spider to crawl in future. In the beginning, the search engine optimizer algorithms were dependant on the keywords, Meta tags, and index files provided by the Webmaster. Meta tags provided information about a particular page, but using them for indexing the pages didn’t prove to be successful as some Webmasters added irrelevant Meta tags to increase the number of hits and earn huge ad revenue. They even changed the HTML of the web pages to achieve a good rank for the page. But this was a case of abuse as it fetched irrelevant pages.  Search engines then began utilizing complex ranking algorithm, which were difficult for the webmasters to manipulate so as to provide web surfers with genuine results. The rank of the web page was calculated mathematically by functions using strength and quantity of the inbound links. The higher the rank of the page the more chances it had to be viewed by a person. Later algorithms were developed which considered various other on-page factors such as rank and off-page factors such as hyperlink. Since the webmasters couldn’t manipulate the page rank, they began exchanging, selling and buying links, which lead to link spamming and even creation of numerous sites dedicated for this purpose. Algorithms became more complex by every passing day and top search engines kept their algorithms a secret. As the cost of SEO increased, advertisers were roped in to pay for it, which finally resulted in high quality web pages. Although investing in SEO is very fruitful, but at the same time is risky because with out any prior notice the algorithms being used are bound to change and the search engine will stop directing visitors to the page. Many consultants are available in the market that provides SEO services. They manipulate the HTML source code of the web site like menus, shopping carts and sometimes even the content of the website to draw more traffic. Search engines like Yahoo has algorithms that extract pages not according to the page rank but according to the cost per click or set fee, that is if a advertiser desires that the page containing his ad be displayed, he is expected to pay money for it. This is a point of controversy, as only the big businesses will be able to increase the number of hits of their page but not the small business who might be having a better quality page.\n\nGoogle Ad Words explores ads which have words typed in the search box by the surfer. The Million Dollar Homepage started the concept of Pixel advertising, which is a graphical kind of advertising. Depending on the pixels, the space is sold to the advertiser. Keyword advertising involves advertisers who buy URLs of a site and place their ads at that location. Thus SEO is a market in its own which is yielding great results for businesses on Internet."},{title:"Advertising Secrets",body:"When I first got into the online advertising business, I was looking for the magical combination that would put my website into the top search engine rankings, catapult me to the forefront of the minds or individuals looking to buy my product, and generally make me rich beyond my wildest dreams! After succeeding in the business for this long, I’m able to look back on my old self with this kind of thinking and shake my head. If you’re reading this article and you’ve come this far, you’re probably looking for the magic answer yourself. You’ve probably read a few dozen or a few hundred articles just like this about pay-per-click advertising, maximizing return on investment, keyword stuffing, black-hat seo tactics, text-link banner exchanges, and the list goes on. Well, I’m here to tell you that I have the one be all end all answer and I’m sharing it with the world! The truth is that there is no magic secret to online advertising. No one method will generate the largest amount of income/exposure for every website or business imaginable – it’s all a matter of trial and error, time and talent. That’s a pretty weak answer, I know. It would have been much cooler for me to tell you that buying tiny classified ads in your local paper was the key to success and riches. Well, I’m sorry. For the few of you that have been down this road before and are starting to get it, you’ll hear a ring of truth in my words. The sooner you stop looking for a quick fix to make your message stick, the better. For what it’s worth, these are my thoughts.\n\n1) The internet has only been alive for a few short years, and in that time it has changed dramatically many times over. Remember in 1995 when everyone first discovered the cool little animated envelope .gif that you would click on to send them email? Where was your online bill-pay, instant messaging, and dynamically generated page content then? And only a few short years later you can see how far we’ve come and use that as a measure for how far we can go. The point is that the internet, like other forms of media, is a rapidly evolving monster. What works for online advertisers today might be completely ineffectual only a few months from now. That’s why the best advertisers are constantly researching and creating their own unique marketing strategies. The trick is to find out what works for you, and to make sure that you revisit it from time to time to tune it up as the market changes.\n\n2) You Have to Spend Money to Make Money. It’s a tired line, but it’s that way because everyone says it. Don’t be afraid to add fuel to your advertising fire and take it to another level. Try investing (note that I said investing and not spending) five, ten, or fifty thousand dollars in advertising. If you don’t jump out a window the first time you do it, you may walk away with a big smile and a little pocket money! The hard part about investing a big chunk of money is coming up with it in the first place. If you already have $50,000 laying around for advertising and are just looking for a place to put it, give me a call. If you’re not that lucky, try looking at the Small Business Administration for ideas on how to get a small business loan. If you don’t want to go farther than your mailbox, examine some of those credit checks your bank keeps sending you in the mail. A lot of people take advantage of their fairly reasonable interest rates to fund projects. 3) Presentation is Key. You’ll find that excellent writing skills and good marketing go hand in hand. As you improve on one, the other is bound to follow. Knowing how to write, and how to write well will give you an extraordinary advantage of the majority of individuals vying for your customers’ attention. I don’t know about you, but I get a lot of spam for people wanting to sell me their “good, cheap, A+ #1 $$$ rolex watch, discount Viagra, H0t s1utz, etc.” Needless to say, I have never purchased anything from them and most likely, neither have you. If you have, please drop me a line and let me know how it worked out. I’m always wondering how many of those are a scam. The emails and circulars that I do purchase from come from GoDaddy, buy.com, Google and a host of other professional companies that take a few minutes to earn my trust with good punctuation, grammar, and quality content.\n\nIf you don’t have a talent for writing (and you know who you are) you have two choices: Get better – easier said than done. Like most things, writing is one part talent and nine parts hard work. Take some classes, do peer editing suggestions, or send it to me look over (first ten-thousand submissions only).\n\nOr, get someone else to do it – leaving more time for you at the helm. I like this option not only because it’s a time saver for me, but also because the work generally comes out better than anything I could have done. This article is an excellent example. I provided a detailed outline, some good anecdotes, and the strategies above and the copywriters at danifer.com did the rest. I made a deal with them to write the article for $149 and we share the syndication rights. Not bad for half an hour’s work. If you can’t afford to hire a pro, be courteous to yourself and your audience by simply re-reading your work, running a spell check, and letting your wife/husband/friend/co-worker look it over. You’d be surprised at how many things invisible to you will stand out to a fresh set of eyes. OK. That’s all I’ve got for now. Stay tuned at howtoadvertise.net for more advice on how to get started with online advertising. Please remember though that how far you go is up to you. There is no substitute for your own work and effort in succeeding in this business."},{title:"3 Smart Reasons Why You Should Consider Paying For Your Traffic",body:"There are numerous success stories you will hear about businesses making it good on the internet . The troubling thing is, there are maybe a tenfold or even a hundredfold of stories inconsistent to theirs. Many have unsuccessfully launched a business venture that is internet based but only a handful shall succeed.\n\nIs this because of luck? That is even more remote. It takes good business sense and a lot of help and team effort. Most importantly, it is the eagerness to succeed and the persistence to learn and the willingness to put in a lot of hard work and some money. However, before shelling out your hard-earned money on advertising, here are three (3) smart reasons why you should consider paying for your traffic including common-sense methods of showing you how to prepare your website.\n\n1. The quickest method for getting customers to your website is to pay for your traffic.\n\nLike Neo, traffic is ‘The One’ . Without traffic, all your efforts would just go to waste. Every business needs customers, without them you wouldn’t have anyone to sell your products to. In the Internet world traffic is the walk in customer. The more traffic you possess the more people you’d be able to sell your products to. But similar to any business that’s in every corner building or in the mall, not everyone that goes in will buy. But for those who do come in to browse your merchandise, most of them will buy your products. It is a clear and known fact.\n\nBut, how do you get traffic, traffic great enough that could make a small portion of resulting buyers enough to make a fair profit. Many big companies generate traffic of tens of thousands a day and a measly ten to fifteen percent actually buys, but that small percentage is enough to supply them with adequate business. Many of these success stories get their traffic from paying others. Yes that’s right; you have to spend money to make money. Advertising is the key. The more people who know that your site exists the more people would of course go to your site, that’s common sense. While there are numerous ways to get free advertising for your business, free advertising doesn’t generate the same high volume of traffic as paid traffic does. Paid advertisements include such advertising schemes as those offered by Google and Yahoo. 2. In order to take full advantage of the search engines, make sure that your site is properly optimized to rank high before paying for your traffic.\n\nSearch engines are the fastest and easiest way for finding what you need on the internet . Search engines are extremely popular because they provide an indispensable service to many people. They are free and easy to use. Because of their popularity, search engines receive many visitors as well as click throughs . With these benefits in mind, it is easy to see why so many companies would pay to advertise with search engines.\n\nSearch engines provide information to the millions of users they receive each day. They provide relevant links to many sites that a user may be looking for. If your site’s link pops up as one of the top ranked sites on the search results page, you stand a great chance that the user will click your link and go to your site. While search engine optimization is a cheaper and low cost way to get your site a high rank, paying for advertisements will ensure that you will be on the top ranks.\n\nWhen you pay for your advertisements, it is like paying for guaranteed traffic to your site. This may not seem like a good idea at first, but the benefits of doing so far outweigh the cost in the long run. When you pay for your traffic, you are guaranteed a consistent flow of traffic to your site. You will at no time go without making a sale on any given day.\n\n3. Find and use tools that will aid you in researching relevant keywords for your chosen niche so that you don’t waste money on advertising.\n\nNormally, you will be charged with the number of hits a link gets when your ad is clicked, this is known as pay per click. For some search engines, you will be charged with the number of times your ad shows up when a certain keyword or keyword phrase is searched. It is imperative that you have good keyword content in your ad. There are many tools on the Internet which can aid you in using the right keywords at the right moment in time. All the money you spend in paying for your traffic will not be for nothing. You will get an impressive boost in traffic which will also result in a great boost in your sales figures."},{title:"Internet Advertising What Went Wrong",body:"Spielberg’s blockbuster, “Minority Report”, is set in the year 2054. The future – at least according to a team of MIT futurologists, hired by the cinematic genius – is the captive of embarrassingly personalized and disturbingly intrusive, mostly outdoor, interactive advertising.\n\nThe way Internet advertising has behaved lately, it may well take 50 years to get there.\n\nMore than 1 billion people frequent the Internet daily. Americans alone spent $69 billion buying things online in 2004. eMarketer, a market research firm, predicts that e-commerce will climb to $139 billion in 2008. American Internet advertising revenues boomed to $7.3 billion in 2003 and $9.6 billion in 2004. Shares of companies like Yahoo! and Google – sellers of online advertising space and technologies – have skyrocketed.\n\nThis is a remarkable reversal from just a few years ago.\n\nAll forms of advertising – both online and print – have been in decline in 2000-2. A survey conducted by the New Media Group of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) – the Internet Ad Revenue Report sponsored by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) – found a 12 percent decline – to $7.2 billion – in Internet advertising in 2001. CMR, The Myers Report, and McCann Erickson have all recorded drops of between 12 and 14 percent in broadcast advertising and of c. 20 percent in radio spots in 2001.\n\nThe following year – 2002 – may have been the turning point. A March 2002 Nielsen NetRatings report registered a sharp turnaround in the first quarter of 2002. The number of unique online ads shot up by one third to 70,000. Jupiter Media Matrix predicted a 10 percent increase in online classified ads – to $1.2 billion in 2002. By 2007, it said, online ads will account for 7 percent of total advertising dollars – some $16 billion. Both IDC and INT Media Group spawned similar prognostications for the weaker Asia-Pacific market.\n\nCMR forecast a 5.3 percent growth in online ad revenues in 2002 – compared to an overall average of 2.5 percent. This optimistic projection is based on expected performance in the – hopefully, more buoyant – third and fourth quarters of 2002.\n\nStill, it was clear in early 2002 that ,even if this surge materializes, online advertising would be almost 7 percent below its level only two years before and vertiginously below projections touted by “professionals” as late as January 2001. Internet.com quoted another gloomy prediction, by Goldman Sachs analyst, Anthony Noto: “The likelihood of an online ad rebound remains questionable in the near term.” Moreover, growth in advertising in local papers, radio spots, and TV spots was expected to outpace the recovery in online ads.\n\nIn hindsight, some advertising categories indeed didn’t make it. Cable, syndication, consumer magazines, national newspapers, outdoor, and B2B magazines continued to post sharp decreases. A sign of the times in 2002 may have been IAB’s multi-million dollar advertising campaign. IAB is the online publishing and ad sales industry’s largest trade association. In 2002, it tried to pitch the Internet to advertisers in what looked like a desperate effort to increase online ad spending.\n\nInternet.com reviewed the campaign in a June 24, 2002 article:\n\n“The gist of the work is that by encouraging consumers to interact with brand elements, marketers can foster greater awareness, favorability and purchase intent – more so than can static media. The executions share the tagline, ‘Interactive is the active ingredient in the marketing mix.'”\n\nThey quoted IAB President and Chief Executive Greg Stuart as saying:\n\n“As we continue to mature as a medium, we need to treat interactive as a brand, and the manner in which we position ourselves as an industry is critical to driving the success and adoption of interactive advertising and marketing in the years ahead. We have to speak with the same voice so that we clearly communicate our unique value to all parties.”\n\nThe collapse in Internet advertising had serious and, in some cases, irreversible implications.\n\nIn a report for eBookWeb.org I wrote:\n\n“Most content dot.coms were based on ad-driven revenue models. Online advertising was supposed to amortize start-up and operational costs and lead to profitability even as it subsidized free access to costly content. A similar revenue model has been successfully propping up print periodicals for at least two centuries. But, as opposed to their online counterparts, print products have a few streams of income, not least among them paid subscriptions. Moreover, print media kept their costs down in good times and bad. Dot.coms devoured their investors’ money in a self-destructive and avaricious bacchanalia.”\n\nSurprisingly, online advertising did not shrivel only or mainly due to its inefficacy – or avant-garde nature. In a survey conducted in early 2002 by Stein Rogan and Insight Express, an overwhelming four fifths of brand marketers and agency executives felt the the Internet is a mainstream medium and an integral part of the conventional marketing mix. Close to 70 percent rated their opinion regarding the effectiveness of online advertising as more positive now than it was 12 months before. A full sixty percent said that their clients are less resistant to interactive marketing than they were.\n\nSo, what went wrong?\n\nAccording to classical thinking, advertising is concerned with both information and motivation. It imparts information to potential consumers, users, suppliers, investors, the community, or other stakeholders. It motivates consumers to consume, investors to invest, voters to vote, and so on.\n\nYet, modern economic signal theory allocates to advertising an entirely different – though by no means counterintuitive – role.\n\nFrom the eBookweb.org report:\n\n“Advertising signals to the marketplace the advertiser’s resilience, longevity, wealth, clout, and dominance. By splurging money of advertising, the advertiser actually informs us – the ‘eyeballs’ – that it is here to stay, sufficiently affluent to finance its ads, stable, reliable, and dominant. If firm X invested a million bucks in advertising – it must be worth more than a million bucks – goes the signal. If it invested so much money in promoting its products, it is not a fly-by-night. If it can throw money at an ad campaign, it is stable and resilient.”\n\nOnline advertising dilutes this crucial signal and drowns it in noise. Advertisers stopped advertising online because the medium’s noise to signal ratio rendered their ads ineffective or even repulsive. Internet users – a “captive audience” – not only became inured to the messages – both explicit and implicit – but found the technology irritating.\n\nMany react with hostility to pop-up ads, for instance. They simply tune off or install ad-filtering software. All major Web browsers allow their users to avoid pop-up ads altogether. But banner ads and embedded ads are an integral part of the Web page and cannot be avoided easily.\n\nThus desensitized, users rebel.\n\n“They resent the intrusion, are incensed by the coercive tactics of advertisers, nerve wrecked by protracted download times, and unnerved by the content of many of the ads. This is not an environment conducive to clinching deals or converting to sales.”\n\nThere are two sources of noise in Internet advertising.\n\nFree advertising misses a critical element in the aforementioned signal. Information about the purported financial health and future prospects of advertisers is conveyed only by paid ads. Free adverts tell us nothing about the advertiser. This simple lesson seems to be lost on the Internet which is swamped by free hoardings: free classifieds, free banner ads, free ad exchanges. Worse, it is often difficult to tell a paid ad from a free one.\n\nThen there is the issue of credibility. Dot.coms – the leading online advertisers – are rarely associated with truth in advertising. Internet ads are still afflicted by scams, false promises, faulty products, shoddy or non-existent customer care, broken links, or all of the above. Users distrust Web advertising and ignore it.\n\nThe Internet is being appropriated by brick-and-mortar corporations and governments. Global branding will transform online ads into interactive renditions and facsimiles of offline fare. Revenue models are likely to change as well. Subscription fees and “author-pays” will substitute for ad revenues. The days of advertising-sponsored free content are numbered."
},{title:"What Is The Big R For Marketing Your Business",body:"Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look at the big ‘R’of recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.\n\nRecognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the far side because they are engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like to model your business after? \n\nYour business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few competitors, that will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to people. \n\nMarketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping it there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business. Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of both television and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this type of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your potential customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never will be your customers. \n\nThere are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be seen by them. \n\nAnother factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from my competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being ignored?  Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long.\n\nDon’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology coming down dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video footage with computer generated graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want to pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people “in the door” of your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you money, time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but if you have successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be worth it."},{title:"Using Banner Stands To Increase Trade Show Traffic",body:"Attending a trade show can be a very effective method of promoting your company and its products. And one of the most effective ways to optimize your trade show display and increase traffic to your booth is through the use of banner stands. A banner stand for your trade show display draws attention to your booth and helps you deliver your message to prospective clients, current customers and business contacts at what is usually a highly competitive event. Your trade show display should stand out from the crowd, and a banner stand is a great way to make sure it does.\n\nBanners themselves are typically constructed with either fabric or vinyl. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of material, so you should consider how you will use your banner stand before deciding between fabric and vinyl. Fabric banners are durable and long-lasting. Fabric doesn’t reflect light like vinyl, which can decrease your banner’s readability. Fabric banners also don’t bend or crease so they travel well. However, fabric banners are not easy to clean and can become dingy or faded with time. Vinyl banners are easy to wipe clean and allow for brighter colors and sharper image definition on them making them more eye-catching than fabric banners. There are many aspects of banner stands that make your investment in one worthwhile. Banner stands can be designed with your company logo or graphics, and include the important information you want to convey to prospective clients. They can be used in conjunction with a trade show display or on their own to advertise a product, announce an event, or showcase information about your business. They can be used as an extension of your trade show booth at a show because they can be set up in other areas like the show lobby or at the end of an aisle. Additionally, banner stands are lightweight, portable, and easy to set up and take down.\n\nOnce you have invested in a banner stand, you will find many uses for this vital piece of equipment outside of trade show displays. Banner stands are reusable and long-lasting. You might consider setting up your custom banner stand in a shopping mall to draw customers into your store, in a hotel lobby to direct the flow of traffic, at a movie theater to advertise an upcoming film, at a sporting event to showcase team information, or wherever your audience is likely to be found. The benefits of a custom banner stand will last your business far beyond trade show displays, and with proper care can be used for several years of succinct, eye-catching advertisement for your business or company."},{title:"Search Engine Optimization And Advertising",body:"In today’s net-savvy world it has become common for any business to have a website which they use mostly for advertising their products and services. With the advent of search engines it has become even easier for the customers to search for the stuff online. For a website to be successful its link should land in the first three pages which the search engine brings and the rank of the page should be high which means many visitors come to the site. This can be achieved by applying search engine optimization or popularly known as SEO. This is a marketing strategy which increases the quality and quantity of traffic flow to a particular website via search engines. SEO not only affects the search engine results, but also image search, video search and industry specific vertical search engines. It determines how a search algorithm functions and searches what is popular with people. When a website link is submitted to a search engine, a spider crawls through a page to gather links which lead to other pages and stores those pages on the server of the search engine. The information collected from these pages is sent to the indexer, whose job is to extract information from those pages such as the keywords and their weights, the location of the page and other links that are stored for the spider to crawl in future. In the beginning, the search engine optimizer algorithms were dependant on the keywords, Meta tags, and index files provided by the Webmaster. Meta tags provided information about a particular page, but using them for indexing the pages didn’t prove to be successful as some Webmasters added irrelevant Meta tags to increase the number of hits and earn huge ad revenue. They even changed the HTML of the web pages to achieve a good rank for the page. But this was a case of abuse as it fetched irrelevant pages.  Search engines then began utilizing complex ranking algorithm, which were difficult for the webmasters to manipulate so as to provide web surfers with genuine results. The rank of the web page was calculated mathematically by functions using strength and quantity of the inbound links. The higher the rank of the page the more chances it had to be viewed by a person. Later algorithms were developed which considered various other on-page factors such as rank and off-page factors such as hyperlink. Since the webmasters couldn’t manipulate the page rank, they began exchanging, selling and buying links, which lead to link spamming and even creation of numerous sites dedicated for this purpose. Algorithms became more complex by every passing day and top search engines kept their algorithms a secret. As the cost of SEO increased, advertisers were roped in to pay for it, which finally resulted in high quality web pages. Although investing in SEO is very fruitful, but at the same time is risky because with out any prior notice the algorithms being used are bound to change and the search engine will stop directing visitors to the page. Many consultants are available in the market that provides SEO services. They manipulate the HTML source code of the web site like menus, shopping carts and sometimes even the content of the website to draw more traffic. Search engines like Yahoo has algorithms that extract pages not according to the page rank but according to the cost per click or set fee, that is if a advertiser desires that the page containing his ad be displayed, he is expected to pay money for it. This is a point of controversy, as only the big businesses will be able to increase the number of hits of their page but not the small business who might be having a better quality page.\n\nGoogle Ad Words explores ads which have words typed in the search box by the surfer. The Million Dollar Homepage started the concept of Pixel advertising, which is a graphical kind of advertising. Depending on the pixels, the space is sold to the advertiser. Keyword advertising involves advertisers who buy URLs of a site and place their ads at that location. Thus SEO is a market in its own which is yielding great results for businesses on Internet."},{title:"Internet Banner Advertising Most Reliable Forms Of Web Advertising",body:"Your cheap internet-based banner advertising will become one of the sought for ads there are.

You get to speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression. So you need to do it right. Following are some tips which will help you do just that.\n\n1) Record everything\n\nAlways write down all details of every phone call. Write down any names and titles you learn. Not just the name of the person you’re trying to contact. The receptionist’s name can be vital to remember as they’re often gatekeepers. Write down when you called, and when you said you’d call back. 2) Use a database or spreadsheet to record everything\n\nYou’ll never manage by hand, and Excel spreadsheets aren’t user friendly in the long term. If you’re prepared to invest in a real CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool, that’s a great idea. If not, you there is a cheaper alternative. I created my own database using Microsoft Access. Visit http://www.divinewrite.com/downloads/contacts and jobs.mdb to download a 208KB working copy for FREE. You’ll need Microsoft Access 2000 to run it. I’m no database expert, so it’s not a work of art. It’ll certainly get you started though. (TIP: When using the database, press Ctrl + ; to enter today’s date.) 3) Always call back when you said you would\n\nDon’t let them down. They may not even remember that you committed to calling back. But if they do, and you don’t meet your commitment, you’ll lose valuable credibility and respect. And wherever possible, work to their schedule. You’re here to help them, not make things harder.\n\nTIP FOR COPYWRITERS: If you’re an advertising copywriter or website copywriter, ask to speak to the Marketing Manager (or if the person who answers the phone says they don’t have a marketing manager, ask for “the person who looks after your advertising & website” – all businesses have that person – it’s generally one of the owners).\n\n4) Always try to get on with the gatekeepers\n\nReceptionists and personal assistants have great influence, and quite often do more of the real work and decision making than the person you’re trying to contact! Make friends with them and you’ve got a foot in the door. (But don’t waste their time or crawl – they get a lot of that!)\n\n5) Keep it short ‘n sweet\n\nWhen you do get to speak with someone, keep it short ‘n sweet unless they want to talk a lot. The purpose of the phone call is to get their attention, let them know you’re there, get their name and contact details, and assess whether they have any requirement for your services. (TIP FOR COPYWRITERS: If you’re an advertising copywriter or website copywriter, you might have called about brochure writing and then find out they need web writing.)\n\n6) DON’T HARD SELL!!! Don’t pressure people or make it hard for them to get off the phone. Tell them what you do and that you’d like to send them an email with a link to your website with samples and testimonials (or with an attachment containing samples), then leave them to it.\n\n7) Follow up with an email\n\nIf you have permission, always send a follow-up email – and do so immediately. Be specific in your subject line. (TIP FOR COPYWRITERS: If you’re an advertising copywriter or website copywriter, use the words “advertising copywriting” or “website copywriting” in the subject. Most people don’t get many emails with this in the subject line, so it’ll be distinctive and probably won’t be snuffed by their spam filter if they have one.) Address the email to them (e.g. “Hi Joe”), keep the email short ‘n sweet. Include only the essential info, make it easy to read and conversational, and bold the important words or phrases as they’ll probably only skim it. Include a link to your website, reference the day and date you talked on the phone (and thank them for that time), mention any names you learnt (e.g. receptionist’s name, especially if the receptionist gave you an email address but you didn’t actually get to speak to the decision maker), tell them that you’d like to follow up in a few weeks (assuming the conversation indicated that this would be a good idea).\n\n8) Follow up with another call\n\nIf the lead looks promising, make sure you follow up. And when you do, always mention the day and date of the original call, as well as the fact that you sent an email. Give a quick summary of who you are and what you do, and say that you’re just calling to make sure they got the email. Most of the time, you’ll find the lead will talk to you about your services, if only to remind themselves of what you do!\n\n9) Don’t expect to make too many calls\n\nOn a really good day, I’ve made 80 cold calls. Most days, though, you should be very pleased to average around 40. You’ll spend a lot of time playing telephone tag.\n\n10) Don’t leave message\n\nUnless you absolutely have to (or you’ve just about given up on the lead), don’t leave messages. Most people have trouble returning phone calls from people they know and like; returning phone calls from someone who’s trying to sell them something isn’t high on their list of priorities.\n\n11) Don’t expect to qualify too many leads\n\nDepending on your business, if you get one good lead a day, you’re probably doing very well. 12) Don’t expect immediate conversion\n\nUnfortunately, most leads take a long time to come to fruition (up to 2 years). So you have to be prepared to be patient.\n\nGood luck and happy calling!"},{title:"Nailing It On The Head With Free Internet Advertising",body:"It is a small world after all.

A business must carefully balance the benefits of these interpersonal relationships and should never allow these relationships to blind their judgment especially when it relates to what is in the best interest of the business’s continued success and growth\n\nBuying advertising media based on interpersonal relationships is a common mistake made by many small businesses. This strategy throws the business’s strategic marketing plan into the winds of chance in exchange for the warm and fuzzy feelings that come with doing business among friends. However, when the smoke clears the business has made costly advertising expenditures with little or no results and the long term negative effects may not readily be seen. Simply, the marketing / advertising expenditures have been made, the budget may or may not be busted, and the results may be none to little measurable penetration into the business’s target demographic market segment.\n\nIs buying media from a friend in the business always bad? No, however in order to choose the most effective media channels a business must first consider the audience or customer it is trying to reach. Developing a strong sense of the target demographics’ buying and shopping patterns, interests and hobbies, entertainment and media choices for example will lend itself a tremendous benefit to making informed media buying choices. Once the advertising business has developed a strong sense of what media channels may prove to be the most effective it should try each a little at a time carefully tracking the results of each. Once this is complete the business will be able to make an educated decision on where to invest its marketing dollars, prioritizing expenditures into the mediums that have proven results for the business.\n\nIt is true that strong interpersonal relationships skills and the ability to develop and maintain good working relationships with a variety of people, businesses, and other organizations are imperative in today’s business environments. However, the importance of a well designed and implemented strategic marketing plan can not be understated and is paramount to the business’s development and longevity never taking second seat to friendship."},{title:"Be Single Minded",body:"You’ve read about the importance of being courageous, rebellious and imaginative.

Regardless of the shape or make of your living accommodation, this is your special place in the world, representing a personal space in which you can feel safe and nurtured. If negotiating this space has become more fearful than friendly, then the installation of a stair lift might just help you feel at home once more. Those of us without mobility issues can easily take the ease with which we can ascend our stairs for granted. A two or three storey house is the ideal way to maximise the piece of earth on which our home sits, but for older or infirm people, this layout is far from practical. As people age, many will choose to move to a single storey home, but for many more, financial or other issues render this choice impracticable. Whether it is money or perhaps the reluctance to leave a cherished family home that holds you back, with the installation of stair lift you can stay put without losing the freedom of your home. If money is a concern, it is wise to shop around before committing to any particular stair lift provider. Because of the nature of the product, the lift will be bespoke to your situation, so fitters will have to visit your home in order to give you an accurate quote. Many companies offer a free estimate without any further obligation, so locate a number of these and compare the prices you are offered. Though your choice of stair lift will partly be dictated by the size and type of staircase in your home, there are many other features that you can select or decline according to your personal taste. To allow you secure a more accurate picture of what is appropriate for you, many companies offer a trial service, which allows you to test a unit that has been installed near your home. Ask whether this service is provided before committing to any particular stair lift vendor.\n\nMobility issues can exert many unwanted effects, but they don’t have to limit your access to your own home. The installation of a stair lift will allow you navigate your home with ease. Don’t let mobility issues confine you – regain your freedom with a stair lift."},{title:"Advertise Advertise Advertise",body:"Many people sign up for affiliate programs with the hopes of making some serious money. They advertise a few places and then wait for the money to start pouring in. When it doesn’t, they blame it on the program and quit.\n\nI am convinced the only way to make money online is to have a consistent Advertising plan. A plan you are willing to work hard on and commit to for a selected period of time. When making this plan, you need to do two things.  First, you should pick a few affiliate programs that are of interest to you. Second, you need to decide how long you want to work these programs. Once you decide on a time period (I recommend 6 months to a year), you must make a promise to yourself that you will not stop advertising until that time period is up. This is perhaps the most important factor in your success.\n\nNext, you need to consider your advertising options: traffic exchanges, classified ads, e-mail campaigns, ezine articles, posting to forums or message boards, chatting with others who are interested in what you have to offer, and posting flyers around your town. Now you see the many possible advertising avenues you can choose from. I recommend doing all of them. It may sound like a lot of work, but when broken down into a plan, it is not.\n\nOne possible plan may look like this: Traffic Exchanges-1 hour per day. Post 15 classified ads per day. Make 5 posts to a message board or forum per day. Submit an article once per week to an ezine. Visit chat rooms and distribute flyers as you have extra time during the week. This all can be accomplished by spending 2-3 hours per day. You will be surprised how much you get done when you have a plan. You may also choose whether you will work 5 or 6 days per week. Make a checklist for each day of the week, and mark each task off as you finish it. That will keep you on focus, and will make you feel good that you are one step closer to reaching your goal.\n\nMake a commitment to your new plan and don’t get involved in any other programs until your current programs are making you money consistently. Don’t give up. Sticking with this plan will significantly improve your success.

In this article I am going to explain the concept of contextual advertising.\n\nFirst I will explain what contextual advertising is. Contextual advertising means the advertising of products on a website according to the content the page is displaying. For example if the content of a website was information on a Ford truck then the advertisements would be for Ford trucks for sale, or Ford servicing etc. It picks up the words on the page and displays ads that are similar to those words. Then when someone either performs an action or clicks on your page you will get paid.\n\nWho can use contextual advertising on their website? Any one with content. Real content. Meaning not links or pictures but word content. There are several companies out there that offer contextual advertising programs. Some of the big ones include Yahoo and Google. Although Yahoo contextual advertising is currently only open to US publishers.\n\nContextual advertising programs sometimes have strict policies that need to be adhered too. Let’s take Google as an example. As mentioned above Google ads can only be placed on pages that have content on them. The most important rule when using contextual advertising is DO NOT click on your own ads. Google has terminated many publishers accounts due to this rule not being followed and have gone to court several times regarding this “click fraud”.\n\nContextual advertising can be profitable. It can either pay for your hosting and maintenance costs for your website or it can pay for a lot more. There are several people that are making thousands a month from contextual advertising.

Take out your business card and look at it in an objective point of view. If you were the customer, would you want to keep the card, or throw it away? Are the fonts on the card too diminutive for clear reading? Or is your design reflective of what your company is in business for? Most businessmen have their company cards printed based on their own subjective preferences, never really taking into consideration if the business cards deliver the necessary message for maximum business impact in such a minimum space. Online connectivity has made it possible for businesses and clients to communicate without hassle, yet it is the business cards which reinforce the presence of the business even in the absence of the Internet. Thus, even when your clients are vacationing in a deserted island, or have gone camping on a mountain side where Internet connection is hard to come by, they are still able to access your business information through the business card, and even better to give your card to a prospective client.\n\nPostcards are also viable ways to generate increased contact for your business but because business cards are handier and easier to fit into a wallet or a business file organizer, they are more certain to be carried anywhere and anytime. Moreover, what is printed on the card is as important as to how the information is printed. A business card should have the name and the logo of the company or business, the slogan or motto of the company, the contact person, contact numbers or cell phone numbers, the business website, and if possible, a physical address.\n\nAny business should never underestimate the power of business cards. It is able to provide quick information, is easy to keep, and if optimized to the fullest, can generate impressive sales increase. Even the empty space at the back of a card can be utilized to hold additional information like a map or an attractive freebie. Business cards can surely help any business to be more well-known and profitable in the long run."

If you’re normal, then you’re much more likely to click on YouTube videos that have a lot of clicks already. The logic is simple. The more views a video has, the more interesting the video must be. After all, why would a video gain so many views if it’s dull or uninteresting, right? Indeed, the bandwagon mentality works very well at YouTube – so why not use it to market your videos at YouTube?\n\nIncrease YouTube Views\n\nIf people are more likely to view a YouTube video that already has thousands of clicks, then increasing your YouTube video’s views will work in your favor. The more hits your video has, the more viewers are likely to watch it. If YouTube videos are a core component of your marketing strategy, this could only be a brilliant move on your part.\n\nThere are two main ways by which you can increase your YouTube views. There’s the call-for-help way in which case you’ll ask your friends, your acquaintances, your friends’ and acquaintances’ friends and acquaintances (etc, etc, etc) to click on and watch your YouTube video. This will require countless telephone calls and emails, of course. Naturally, it will also take some time before you see your YouTube video’s views snowballing. On the other hand, you can increase YouTube views by purchasing YouTube views at http://buyyoutubeviews.com/.\n\nWhy Buy YouTube Views?\n\nBuying YouTube views is far more practical than asking friends, acquaintances, etc. to view your YouTube video. By investing a small amount, you can have as much as 150,000 views on your YouTube video in 48 hours. After 48 hours, other people are going to notice your video and think: “Wow, this video has so many hits; I’ve just got to see what the buzz is about.” In result, your YouTube video will get even more views than you have initially paid for, and more and more people are going to be exposed to the marketing message contained in your video."},{title:"Understanding Colors",body:"Color is so powerful that it can persuade, motivate, inspire and touch people’s soft spot – the heart. This is the reason why understanding colors is pretty crucial in relating and communicating with other people. Not only that, it is also important to businesses in order for their business to sell.\n\nThere are many uses of colors. Here are some of the many:\n\n1. Commercial Offset Printing. In the commercial printing industry as well as the online printing services interface, colors are essential to ascertain the efficiency of the printed materials. Usually, printing companies use four-color printing, two-color printing and Pantone which is also known as PMS.\n\nFour-color printing also known as full color or 4 color printing is a process of creating colors using the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) colors. Instead of physically mixing the colors, four colors mix a spectrum of colors using CMYK in order to create the colors desired. Two-color printing is a color printing process which uses two colors only. This is especially applicable in printing 2-colored logos and postcards. This process is one of the cheapest among the printing processes available these days. Pantone or PMS (Pantone Matching System) is a color system of mixed inks. If you want a specific color for your company logo this is the right color printing process for you. PMS is capable of finding the exact color that you need. Nonetheless, this may be a little costly compared to the rest. 2. Colors in the Computer Monitor. In order to create colors in the motor, it uses three base colors with full spectrum – Red, Green and Blue. By simulating these three colors, other colors are formed. Each base color has 0 or no light emission to 255 or full light emission. Computer monitors can also convert RGB to CMYK colors. The need is to ascertain the equivalent color of RGB to CMYK so that the print results are similar to that displayed on the monitor. 3. Paints. Industrial paints need specific colors to complement fixtures and designs. Usually, industrial paints are matched using the Pantone Matching System. To do this, choose a PMS color first then your choice of paint. That way it will be easy to pick paint colors.\n\n4. Desktop Printers. Use the four-color printing system to reflect an accurate color for your documents, pictures and graphics. What you see on your monitor may not appear exactly as printed. This is because computer monitors are using RGB color system.\n\nNow, you can zero in on your color preferences. Good luck!"},{title:"Creative Outdoor Ads",body:"They are big, bold and beautiful. Billboards have been around for quite a while. In almost all places nowadays you can find billboards of just about every product there is in the market. No matter how you see it, billboard advertising is on the rise. Compared to other forms of advertising, billboards are a more affordable way of getting your message across to the public. If newspaper advertising lasts only for a day and a television advertisement last for only about forty seconds, billboard adverting last 24/7. Billboards can connect easily with potential markets because more people are mobile nowadays – referring to the increasing number of commuters and more time spent outside of the house. Advances in technology have also made billboards more cost effective. Advances in digital printing have also allowed billboards to be printed cheaply and quickly on canvas. Lately, billboards have been getting pocket-friendly as well.\n\nBut before you get your creative juices flowing and before you plunge into the exciting world of billboard advertising there things you need to understand. First, don’t expect the billboard to contain a lot of information. This is not just possible. The number one rule in billboard advertising is simplicity. This rule simply means that you need to use only a few words to get your message across. But this doesn’t mean that you can no longer make complex, intelligent and intriguing statements. You still can but in the simplest way you can. Say three balls are thrown to you at the same time. Chances are you will not catch all these balls let alone catch one. Throwing three balls at the same time is like throwing several ideas and message to your audience at the same time. If you throw one idea at a time chances are most of your readers will grasp it and walk away with the message. But if you throw two ideas at the same time only few will be able to get your message. So pay attention to the golden rule and keep your billboard simple. The price for disregarding the rule is wastage of thousands of dollars but the reward can lead to huge fame and fortune.  In billboard advertising it is also important to know your market. It pays to be aware of what your customers need and where most of your customers are to be able to strategically and effectively place your billboard. If billboards are put up in the wrong place and at the wrong crowd you might as well forget your chance of getting a lot of customers. Money is indeed being made in billboard advertising, lots of it in fact, although trying to keep track of just how much the outdoor-advertising industry is collecting in can be tricky, since there is no system for measuring the budgets and revenues of those connected with it. But the opportunity is there. Businesses just have to make an effort and take advantage of it."},{title:"Home Business Advertising Ideas",body:"Having a home based business is a wonderful asset to your life.

MTA web directory is the simplest way in which one can bid on a link, or a few links if they wish to do so. The link directory on MTA displays all of the links it currently has, and does so in alphabetical order, which makes it much easier for someone to find what they are looking for if it is something specific and they do not want to go through all the other sites and links as well. It allows you to start your bid at the bottom and slowly work your way to the top of the list. With a very low costing starting bid of just $1, you are guaranteed to have a spot in MTA’s successful directory list.  When you would like to increase your bid to one of the top positions, you have to know that this would be a wise decision to make as it will not only get your link to be at a higher point in the directory but it will also give you a chance to have your site advertised with the rest of the top ten on the home page of the website. This means that when visitors come to MTAweb.com, your site will be one of the first things they see. In other words, you stand a great chance at getting a comeback to your site sooner than you thought.\n\nIt is important that you buy links because the links are what get you the results that you want. The popularity of the links that are listed in the MTA directory is in fact one of the most important factors in the performance of the search engine. Links are important and this is why you have to purchase a link in order to bid on something and the best part is that a link will only cost you $1, which is nothing compared to what you would pay if you decided to do it through any other company or website.\n\nBy escalating the quantity of links to your web site, you will be able to have your site listed much higher in all the search engine results. So when your site is looked for on the search engine it will be very easy to come across as it will come up as one of the first. This will bring many more people to your web site as well as increase your Google PageRank. It will also improve on the whole strength of your web site. Making it better, faster and more interesting each time."},{title:"Advertisers Embrace Rich Media Format",body:"From ads that dance or sing to MTV-like commercials, online advertisers are now using a new type of technology called “rich media” to attract consumers.\n\nU.S. Internet advertising revenue will have reached about $12 billion last year, up $3 billion from 2004. Of this, advertisers spent about $1 billion on rich media, up from $800 million in 2003, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.\n\nSo what exactly is rich media? By definition, it is an online advertising technique that combines graphics with audio technologies, giving Internet users an interactive experience. And with more than half of American households connected online and using high-speed connections like broadband and DSL, it means a potentially lucrative way for online advertisers to get consumers’ attention.\n\nOne company taking online advertising to a different level is Centale Inc. (OTCBB: CNTL), based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The online marketing and technology firm offers cutting-edge technology solutions to its clients.\n\nCentale’s premier application, the Catalyst EV, is a software platform that allows companies to communicate directly to the desktop of their audience in rich media format.\n\nThe software also functions independent of e-mail. To date, studies have shown that e-mail campaigns may be decreasing in effectiveness because as the amount of e-mail increases, the likelihood of success of the solicitation or advertisement tends to decrease.\n\nOne reason that advertisers are embracing rich media is that it typically entertains and is compelling enough to capture the interest of consumers. It also allows a user a modicum of control by either stopping the ad entirely, or participating in it and clicking through to an advertiser’s Web site to get more information.\n\nWhile rich media may not endear advertising to online consumers, most users are finding it less intrusive than traditional pop-up, banner and text-based ads. Centale says there is a favorable market for its product, as the industry shifts away from traditional advertising such as print and radio in favor of online advertising."},{title:"Effective Forms Advertising Internet Web Site",body:"I have detailed below the most cost effective forms of internet marketing to advertising your business using your company website.

Companies and organizations that understand the importance of publicity are generally more successful than those who use advertising alone to reach their target audiences.\n\nNewspapers, magazines and radio and television news programs are filled with stories about businesses and organizations. Those who know how to present materials professionally to the right people will get media coverage for free, while those who don’t understand how publicity works have to rely on large advertising budgets to reach their audiences, usually with less impressive results.\n\n“If you can get a news organization to report about your event or praise something you’re doing, you have gained an enormous amount of credibility that simply couldn’t be generated through paid advertising,” said David Forman, a public relations veteran and author of “Publicity Professor,” a workbook that teaches business owners how to get free news coverage.\n\nThe first step in reaching out to media professionals is to create an appealing press release. Its main purpose is to get an editor or producer interested in what you have to say or in what you are doing. It should contain enough information, specifics and quotes that a writer can craft a story from it without ever having to call you.\n\nA media alert is another tool for getting press coverage. Its purpose is to give news assignment desks the specifics about an event in a way that entices editors or television news directors to send a reporter or camera crew.\n\nThere are dozens of other ways to get news coverage, such as placing feature stories or writing pitch letters offering your expertise in a subject for quotes or on-air interviews.\n\nForman says you don’t have to hire outside help to get publicity.\n\n“Nobody knows your business like you do,” Forman said. “You simply have to reach the appropriate person with your message, in a format that media professionals expect.”\n\nUsing real-world examples, “Publicity Professor” shows you how to give editors and producers exactly what they’re looking for to get your story covered for free.\n\nThe guidebook includes easy-to-follow templates of press releases, media alerts, feature stories and pitch letters; suggestions on creating newsworthy special events and awards programs; and resources for contacting local, regional and national media."},{title:"Consumer Psychology In The Industrial And Manufacturing Equipment Marketplace",body:"People like a “special” price or exclusive offer directed only to them. Most Industrial and Manufacturing equipment buyers are seeking to be told that they are special. Through a great deal of trial and error writing advertisements for Industrial and Manufacturing Equipment classifieds, I have learned to employ this technique to each and every classified and auction description I create. Most successful online auction and classified listings are based on the element of exclusivity. First and foremost I almost always use a “special deal” offered only thought the channel I am using to market my equipment. It is important to stress that No outsider can participate and that the offer is only available if the buyer responds to the specific equipment listing where the savings or price point is offered. Keeping with the same theme “FREE” is becoming an over used term on the web. While offering free shipping, free equipment installation or free support can be a useful technique in driving sales, it’s important not to over use the term. If you choose to use a “Free” offer of some kind it’s important to stress to you potential buyer why receiving the free service or ancillary product is so beneficial.\n\nRemember that selling Industrial Equipment online is no different than selling any other product. Those of us that endeavor to sell not only the highest quality products, but to understand the buying habits as well as the psychology of our consumers, will succeed where others fail."},{title:"Why Do You Need To Join An Affiliate Marketing Network",body:"Affiliate marketing is the latest trend online. With so many products to sell and services to offer, sometimes displaying it on one site isn’t enough. Thus, advertisers or merchants need affiliates, some sites which are willing to display ads for a particular cost. On the other hand, this is an opportunity for potential affiliates to earn extra income online.\n\nThe easy way to earn from affiliate marketing is to join an affiliate marketing network. Joining poses several benefits to both the advertiser and the affiliate. For the advertisers, this opens a new door of opportunity to get more leads and sales, get higher return on investment and pay only for results.

People are beginning to look at this type of marketing as an important aspect of pushing websites forward.

I’m illustrating the marketing challenges of PrescottWeddings.com, a small business. If you don’t remember anything else about marketing, remember this: Frequency is king.\n\nThe more often you can get your name in front of your potential and current customers, the more likely you will make a sale.\n\nDepending on what study you look at, people need to see your message anywhere from three to 27 times before they act upon it.\n\nAnd, if you want to brand your business, then you need to get it in front of your customers as often as possible.\n\nHow do you think Ivory Soap, Campbell Soup and Tide all built their brands so deeply into our minds? Through years and years of repeatedly advertising. That’s why those brands pop into our head when we think about soap, soup or laundry detergent.\n\nSo if you want to build your brand, then you need to advertise frequently.\n\nThere’s another benefit to advertising frequently. It also helps your current customers.\n\nPeople like to know they made the right decision after they purchased something. How much reassurance they need depends on how much they spend, but everyone needs some confirmation they made the right decision. Your advertising can help.\n\nStudies have shown that people are more aware of car ads after they purchased a car — specifically car ads of the model they bought. And they’re more likely to both believe and approve of the message. Again, because they want to know they made the right decision. So there are many good reasons to advertise frequently. Does that mean you have to spend a fortune? Not necessarily. There are a few tricks you can use to get the frequency you need at a low cost. (These are print tricks — other advertising outlets, such as radio and online, we’ll talk about in future issues.)\n\n1. Make your ad as small as possible. Small ads cost less. See “Advertising on a Budget – Part 2: Thinking Small” for more information on shrinking your ad.\n\n2. It’s better to schedule your ads to run all at once than spread them out. People will never remember when they don’t see your ad, only when they do. If they see your ad a lot in one week, they’re going to be under the impression you advertise all the time because they won’t remember NOT seeing your ad other weeks.\n\n3. Take advantage of any frequency programs your newspaper offers. And definitely sign a contract — don’t run ads under the open rate.\n\nHere’s how it worked for PWC.\n\nThe newspaper had a program called “3 For Free.” If you ran an ad three days in a row, you got the next three days for free (the paper was published six days a week).\n\nWe designed a tiny ad — a one by two inch ad — and we ran it six days in a row. Then we skipped the next three weeks and did the same thing again the next month.\n\nAfter a year of doing this, PWC had people coming up to her telling her they saw her ad “all the time.” Business owners wanted to advertise on PWC because they could see the commitment PWC had to advertising. Brides and grooms were visiting PWC on a regular basis because they were being “reminded” monthly.\n\nWhat did all this cost? About $100 a month.\n\nBut, a word of caution. It takes time to build a business and a brand. It won’t happen overnight. But it will happen, especially if you remember to keep getting your name in front of your customers and potential customers as often as you possibly can."},{title:"There Is No Competition",body:"Recently I came across an exciting video on the internet. The video was packed with information about marketing and how cooperation between the owners of businesses in the same industry can do a great deal more for one another and in effect for themselves, than they could hope to do for themselves if they consider others in their industry to be competitors. This concept, that there is no competition in your industry, gives you a tremendous leverage in business. Results from the effort of one person are more than doubled when a second person joins the first person. Consider the following scenario; it should serve to give you a clear understanding of how results are multiplied through cooperation. When working on hydraulic test stands a single person working alone would spend considerable time having to run piping through a large wall,walking from one side of the wall, to the end of that wall and around to the other side of the wall to a specific point along the wall to connect the piping he/she just ran through the wall to a testing station. Then once the testing was complete the person would have to return to the other side of the wall and repeat the process at a different point in the wall. When two people are working in cooperation, each can stand on opposite sides of the wall and run piping through the wall to be immediately connected and tested on the other side of the wall. In addition, while the testing is taking place by one of the people, the other person would simultaneously begin running piping through the wall at the next point in the wall. The two people would continue doing so, along the full length of the wall, thereby increasing the results by more than double. So as can be seen here, cooperation instead of competition can go a long way to place each individual far ahead of where he/she would be by merely “going it” alone. And in the midst of the harmony of cooperation, people enjoy an extra reward of happiness that those who are selfish or greedy can never feel.\n\nI hope this article serves to increase results for you."},{title:"Effective Advertising Pointers",body:"Businesses often become known today through effective marketing.

The headline should attract the reader and make him read the rest of the advertisement.

Words in headlines should act as tags for the advertisement. It should say it all about the content that follows. If a company is selling reasonably priced furniture, the headline of their advertisement should be ‘Durable furniture for less price’. This headline will attract the right customers who are on a look out for durable furniture as well as low cost furniture. If the customers to be reached belong to a category that are interested in decorating their house with beautiful furniture and aren’t concerned about the price to get the right look, then the headline can be ‘Change how your house looks by our oriental furniture’.

If both men and women can use a product, both of them should be referred to in the title, missing out even one of the category is like losing a huge number of potential customers. \n\nThe title should be instant product seller. According to a research, five times more readers read just the headline when compared to those who read the complete advertisement. So the investment is of no use, if the title isn’t good enough to sell the product. There can be a possibility that the content of the ad isn’t strong enough. All the harm can be undone by having a powerful headline. The headline should be centered on the product and not the company that is selling the product. The customer’s interest should be reflected and he should feel that he is directly addressed. Start with ‘you’ and not ‘we’. So if the client specified on mentioning the company’s name, don’t start the sentence with it. For example, instead of writing ‘Tylenol – solution for sever cold ‘, write ‘Got sever cold? Try Tylenol’. Never forget to mention the name of the product in the headline. The product name should be of top priority. A snapshot of the benefits of the product should be given in the headline. This is an important quality of a well-phrased headline. The customers look out for advantages when he thinks of buying a product.

If a visual is placed in the advertisement, it will be a good complement. As a picture speak thousand words.

Too much of cleverness should not be applied to design a headline. There are nearly five hundred advertisements in a local newspaper on weekends. A regular reader reads the headings of all of them. He will be able to classify between a false heading and a genuine heading. No false promises or information should be included in the headline. Over smart headlines are good for award competitions, but don’t really work with the savvy customers. The headline should give out a positive feeling to the reader. Negativity should be totally excluded as it not only creates a negative impression but the mind will also be not receptive friendly.

Before we get to the tips let’s look at the basic strategies of successful advertising.\n\n* In order to be successful, your advertising must provide a consumer benefit or solve a problem.\n\n* That benefit or solution must be wanted by the consumer.\n\n* The product or service you are offering must be tied directly to that benefit or solution.\n\n* The benefit or solution must be distinctly communicated through medial advertising. In other words, be clear, forget the advertising glitz and make sure the message isn’t lost in the ad.\n\nAverage cost of advertising is usually 1 to 5% of gross sales, which can vary according to location, local advertising rates, and industry. Budget conscious advertisers must achieve top results for their advertising dollar. Expand your dollars by adopting some creative techniques.\n\nSome Tips\n\n* Place your ads in off hours or in unusual locations on discounted rates. This will help you in containing the cost. Many times you can still reach your target market with these spots.\n\n* Instead of a one-time big splash ad, be consistent with frequent small ads that work to keep reminding your customers of your presence.\n\n* Consider advertising in regional issues of national magazines. The costs are lower and you can reach your target market. TV Guide is also a good choice. It stays around for at least a week.\n\n* Sponsor a community event if you can like a fun-run, golf tournament, or other event that will be well publicized in the community. Your name may not be prominently displayed but sometimes the positive exposure in the community will bring in new customers.\n\n* Exploit the media you choose to the fullest. If your message is verbal, you don’t need TV. Use radio, billboards and newspapers to the fullest.\n\n* Consider direct mail. A letter and brochure before customer contact can increase business.\n\n*Hire an advertising design agency which might not be top of the heap, but can get creative and specializes in interactive campaigns to provide you with creative design solutions.\n\nI hope these tips will help your business grow.

The environment is called brand and the definition is as follows: the brand is a collection of ideas and images, a collection that constitutes an undivided whole meant to transmit and sustain the values of a company, a product or a service. As you have noticed, this definition has brought into discussion two defining elements: idea and image. I’d like to emphasize that it is important to follow this order: ideas come first and images are born out of ideas to visually represent them. Once we have known the environment and its definition, we can discuss about the functions that the logo must fulfill.\n\nThe first function: the logo defines and incorporates values.\n\nThe logo must be designed according to the values which we want it to transmit. As the visual impact can mean much more than a description and the logo will [probably] be the most important visual element, it is recommended that it is given its due importance.\n\nThe second function of the logo is to communicate values.\n\nThe logo does the communication between the company and the consumer and, besides the product itself, it is the first element that presents the service provider.\n\nThe third function of the logo is to represent values.\n\nThe logo represents a company, an association or another [mainly] legal entity.\n\nLet’s recapitulate – we have identified three major functions of the logo:\n\n– it defines values\n\n– it communicates values\n\n– it represents values\n\nThe functions of the logo never change; they only exist. In order to efficiently explore them, the logo must be relevant. In the case of a company, it must be relevant both for the institution, the product or the service provider and for the market. In the case of a non-profit institution, the logo must be relevant for the institution and for the socio-cultural environment.\n\nThe conclusion: the logo must be suggestive, but not too open to interpretation. The message that it transmits must be ambiguous enough but without leaving room to wrong interpretations. The functions of the logo can be neither negotiated, nor influenced. They begin to work along with the social exposure of the logo. All we can do is to establish relevant values and constantly sustain them."},{title:"Vinyl Banners With Its Different Types Kinds And Applications",body:"One way to announce or promote a certain new product or special events is perhaps through using of vinyl banners.

Whether you want to purchase a vehicle, bed, or pet, the classified section of your local newspaper can be one of the best resources available. With the emergence of the web however, many sites are being developed to host free classifieds. More and more people are using the web daily; making these classified sites some of the most popular sites around. Free classified ad sites are great for other things as well however. If you are an owner of a business, you may consider utilizing free classified as sites to boost business. There are many advantages to this idea, so take a look below to learn how to make use of this efficient resource. Using free classified ad sites are great for every business owner, but they are most appropriate for the business owner with little or no advertising budget. By using free classified sites, a business owner can reach thousands of potential customers. People who look in classifieds are often those consumers who are prepared to spend money. These types of customers are those that are most likely to make purchases, which are the best consumers you can possibly attract as a business owner. Reaching thousands of potential buyers however does take a little more than simply posting your business’s name in the classified site’s general section. To get the best response possible, you should use these tips when posting.\n\nFirst, think about your business and what you have to offer. Then decide which section of the classifieds your business would most appropriately fit into. By posting in the most appropriate location, you will be reaching those consumers that you most likely want to reach. For instance, if you own a dog collar company, then you likely should post in “pets” or “pet supplies”. This will help you gain the attention of pet owning consumers. If you were to post your dog collar business in the general section, it is likely it would get lost among the other ads in that area. By posting in a specific area, your ad will get more valid attention. Next, think about how much attention you want your ad to receive. If you want to get as much attention as possible, you may want to post your ad on several free classified sites. This will allow you to get more exposure at no extra cost. Sure, it may take you longer to set your ads up on several different sites, but it will be worth the extra effort by gaining more business. Try to find at least five sites to begin with. If you have a local business, consider using sites that are heavily advertised in your area. This will allow you to gain more local business as well. When you are developing your ad, you will need to consider the approach you want to use. The best way to get eyes on your ad is to use simple text tactics. These can include using “bold” text or text in colors like blue or red. Any way you can make your ad different from those around it is the best way to get attention. If the site offers extra “frills” for a small fee, you may even want to consider it. With very few people using the extras, your ad would certainly stand out. After you decide the basics, you need to choose exactly what you want to say in your ad. You can state the basics such as your business name, address, and phone number to begin with. Make sure you also state an email address however or website address. Many people who use the web often would much rather contact your business via email or your website. By neglecting to add these bits of information, you will likely lose some interested consumers. There is no argument that when you are looking for an inexpensive way to advertise, free classified sites are the best approach. By choosing the most appropriate sites, areas to post, formats, and text, you are likely to gain a great deal of attention to your business. Utilizing these free sites is a great way to save yourself money as well as reach an audience you might not reach without using the classified sites."},{title:"7 Ways To Advertise Your Business For Free",body:"1. Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post once and they are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.\n\n2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.\n\n3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.\n\n4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.\n\n5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.\n\n6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and they are free to download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.\n\n7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People will tune you out if they see the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream."},{title:"Make Money Online Through Advertising",body:"You don’t need to have a full time ecommerce business to earn a little extra money through your website. You don’t even need to be there all the time. All you need to do is wait for the day your advertisers will pay you.\n\nHowever, this is not as easy as it seems. You can’t expect to just make a website and watch the money roll in. You have to exert first the effort to make the site popular and produce a huge traffic flow. Advertisers would only post their banners and ads on sites where they know there are many people who will see them. The more traffic and visitors you have the likely the chance that advertisers will want their ads on your site. You can also have pay-per-click advertising in your site.

But it is too long. In their business advertisers have to follow some rules to enhance the process of customer’s perception of the presented information. However, they are very often overlooked. It is really very annoying. So I suggest turning everything upside down and to make a flop of your ad take advantage of this “wrong” advice: The first wrong advice. Open your ad with the words “If you want …” The client will hesitate whether he really needs your service or goods. As a rule, he comes to conclusion that he will buy it later, but not now.\n\nThe second wrong advice. There should be a lot of cheerful and spicy remarks about the client’s flaws. Start with describing them “Are you going bald?” The third wrong advice: From the very first phrase, let your client understand that your product is the most unique and universal thing. For example, “Our thesis writing service solves all your problems”. The fourth wrong advice. If you are new in the business, there is nothing better than the headline “Company” so and so “presents”. The thought that there is a person who does not know the name of your wonderful firm should never occur to you. The fifth wrong advice. There are so many various prints! It is a crime not to use them. The best variant is to write every word in a different print. Give preference to decorative types, especially it concerns your contact information. The client will spend several pleasant minutes guessing if it is 3 or 9, b or d. To bring your clients complete satisfaction use the smallest type for writing your address and phone number. You don’t want your clients to find where your office is.\n\nThe sixth wrong advice. When we are reading the text, we are saying it to ourselves. That is why the larger the print – the more emotional and appealing our ad is. Make your print larger with every new phrase; make the main parts in bold and the more italicised parts – the more impressive your ad looks. The seventh wrong advice. Preach at your customer: Of course you don’t know that… or “You have no idea that…” Let him understand that God deigned to concede him. The eighth wrong advice. Your business is the most important thing I the world and you won’t deal with those who don’t think so. You don’t need their money. That is why don’t take time to explain something. Use many special terms and learned words. Let the client suffer from inferiority complex. Don’t take pains to explain how these goods can help him. He must think about it himself. If he does not know, he must find out it for himself. Any way he has nothing else to occupy himself with. The ninth wrong advice. Don’t divide your text into paragraphs. Your text is as precious as a computer science thesis you defended years ago and the reader must peruse every word. Your text should contain as many subordinate clauses as possible. I even would not write the tenth tip as if you follow these ten ones your sales rates will remain just the same.

This powerfull marketing tool is often used matter of factly, and we have to wonder how often does the recipient of your card hold on to it, and use your business information positively?\n\nIn a world where first impressions count and business is becoming more competitive, it would be foolish to go with the crowd. You have to act different to make a impact so that you will be remembered when the rest are forgotten. Often times, traditional business cards reflects your name, position in the company and contact details…not very inspiring. Full colour business cards might be a better option, but once again,you would have needed to make some kind of impression, for the recipient of your card to give it a second glance.\n\nIn my opinion then, it’s not your actual business information that counts, but how you present it. I recently, in a situation typical to the one described above, held my photo business card that is printed on vinyl, back until the meeting drew to an end. I kindly requested my prospects to pass their diaries on to me…they did so, but looked a bit dazed. I sticked my information in their diaries and passed it back with a remark that I accept that sometimes things get lost, but NOT my business cards. Surprised smiles all around, I knew I made a definite impression and they might just follow up on my information.

Thereby, choosing the right business card design is important and requires careful considerations so that it will not look cheap and may tarnish your reputation in this highly competitive business world today. Here are some pointers to help you create an effective business card design:\n\nNature of Business\n\nAlways remember to choose a theme that best suits your business, individual style and your business industry. If you’re in the childcare industry, a formal black and white type of card may not be quite effective for making a favorable impression among your clients. Color and Images\n\nYou need to pay special attention to the type of colors in your business cards. Colors should be matched according to your business industry and style. For instance, if you’re in the funeral industry, bright-luminous type of colors may not be too appropriate. Considering the limited space of a business card, do keep the amount of images to the minimum for easier referencing. Placement of Business Details\n\nEnsure the placement of your personal and business attributes are in the correct order. Important details such as name, phone number and email address should be printed clearly. Unnecessary information should be kept away as much as possible.\n\nKeep Your Business Details Up-to-date\n\nEnsure that the details of your business card are up to date. Business card with outdated contact numbers and addresses should be amended before distributing to your clients."},{title:"Types Of Paper In Catalog Printing",body:"There are many things that are important to catalog design. Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for the text is important. The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s product pages all play important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new customers and sales.\n\nHowever none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of paper you will choose to print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important to your potential customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the more product they will buy. In this article I will go over some of the many paper choices you have to print your catalog on.\n\nFirst you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your catalog. In most cases the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages.\n\nSecond you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your catalog. Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can still display your products well.\n\nSo you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will my cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”\n\nOnce you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight of the paper will be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be 60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight. Some is measured by thickness or “points”.\n\nNow the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you can choose from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a high-end or expensive product.\n\nThere are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be printed on. Such as the method of printing you are going to choose.\n\nIf you are going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press then the ink air-dries and is absorbed into the paper. A cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper.\n\nIf your printer uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high quality papers they have available. The same goes for printers that do digital printing.\n\nIt will depend a lot on the printer you choose. You need to find out what type of paper is available and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better idea of which one you want to print your catalog on. Also ask your printer to suggest the different types of paper they think will be the best for your catalog.\n\nHere is a list of some of the types of paper your printer may have available for you to choose from or may be able to order for you.\n\nDull Coated Paper\n\nMatte Coated Paper\n\nGlossy Coated Paper\n\nAntique Paper\n\nVellum Paper\n\nWove Paper\n\nSmooth Paper\n\nFelt Paper\n\nLinen Paper\n\nFiber-added Paper\n\nLaid Paper\n\nParchment\n\nFour things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and ppi. (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the paper. It affects how your text will stand out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is visible from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your text and images from one page will be seen through onto another page that your customer is trying to read. The finish affects the feel of the pages and also how your images will look. The lower grade finishes produce grainier images while high quality finishes sharpen the look of your images.\n\nAsk your printer to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for printing your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know what your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses you have to consider."},{title:"Promote With Postcards",body:"Postcards have been consistently one of the more popular collectibles and used as promotional materials.

Among the entire methods billboard advertising is the most sort after method, which has been proven to be the best sales strategy in the recent times. Nearly 5.6 billion dollar was spent on billboard advertising alone, in the year 2006, as analyzed by Outdoor Advertising Association of America. Billboard advertising is the best bet in outdoor advertising and isn’t that costly. And with the amount of exposure the product gets the money is worth it. In the past few years several factors have triggered billboard advertising and cost effectiveness being one of the prime reasons. One of the reasons being if an ad is placed in the local newspaper or a television channel the advertisement gets noticed for only thirty seconds and when the same advertisement is placed on billboard, it gets noticed through out the day, for months. Thousands of people view billboard everyday on their way to jobs or home, it doesn’t get lost in the pages like an advertisement placed in a newspaper or magazine. There is a frequent and continuous delivery of message. No other advertising method can grab the attention of people like billboard advertising. It creates brand awareness and strong name recognition. One of the reasons behind the cost being low is technology. In the early years the billboards were hand-painted due to which the labor cost was high. Now, advertisers design and print their advertisements on a huge poster board or vinyl board by a computer-aided printer, which is very cost effective. Creativity can be achieved to the highest extent, with ease and less money. The brighter, colorful, creative the advertisement is, the more eye-catching it is. With the advancements in technology, it takes very less time to design billboards with unlimited possibilities. Before placing a billboard advertisement in a particular area it’s better that a research is done about the interest of the people in and around that area. Like if the advertiser desires to post a billboard advertisement on a highway, he can choose the advertisement on a motel, cafeteria, or gas station. Depending on the locality specific potential customers should be targeted. The cost is really reasonable. It varies from $1,000 to $3,000 per month. Ten advertisements will cost around $ 30,000. It might look like a big amount, but it costs almost same if placing a full-page ad in a newspaper for only a day. And if the effectiveness is considered for both the methods, newspaper advertisements are not even half as effective as billboard advertisements. When an advertisement is placed in a newspaper or in a magazine, the customer should reach out to see the advertisement, but when an advertisement is placed on a billboard, it is like reaching to the customers.  \n\nThus, Billboard advertising has high-impact on people and is a cost-effective method of advertisement. The above-mentioned advantages are few of the many advantages of billboard advertising. And that’s the reason why all types of companies and businesses are choosing to go with billboard advertising. From placing the billboard at a theater multiplex, highway, airport, and even pasting them on cars, any kind of product can be advertised to any kind of audience. And the effectiveness of it can never be underestimated."}]},function(e,t){e.exports=[{title:"The Night Sky",body:"No matter how far along you are in your sophistication as an amateur astronomer, there is always one fundamental moment that we all go back to.

Most of us have no idea the vast panorama of lights that dot a clear night sky when there are no city lights to interfere with the view.\n\nSure we all love the enhanced experience of studying the sky using binoculars and various sizes and powers of telescopes. But I bet you can remember as a child that very first time you saw the fully displayed clear night sky with all the amazing constellations, meters and comets moving about and an exposure of dots of light far to numerous to ever count.\n\nThe best way to recapture the wonder of that moment is to go out in the country with a child of your own or one who has never had this experience and be there at that moment when they gaze up and say that very powerful word that is the only one that can summarize the feelings they are having viewing that magnificent sky. That word is – “Wow”.\n\nProbably the most phenomenal fact about what that child is looking at that is also the thing that is most difficult for them to grasp is the sheer enormity of what is above them and what it represents. The very fact that almost certainly, virtually every dot up there in the sky is another star or celestial body that is vastly larger that Earth itself, not by twice or ten times but by factors of hundreds and thousands, can be a mind blowing idea to kids. Children have enough trouble imagining the size of earth itself, much less something on such a grand scope as outer space.\n\nBut when it comes to astronomy, we do better when we fall into deeper and deeper levels of awe at what we see up there in the night sky. Some amazing facts about what the children are looking at can add to the goose bumps they are already having as they gaze eyes skyward. Facts like…\n\n*	Our sun is part of a huge galaxy called the Milky Way that consists of one hundred billion stars just like it or larger. Show them that one hundred billion is 100,000,000,000 and you will se some jaws drop for sure.\n\n*	The milky was is just one of tens of billions of galaxies each of which has billions of stars in them as well. In fact, the Milky Way is one of the small galaxies.\n\n*	If you wanted to drive across the Milky Way, it would take you 100,000 years. But you can’t get there driving the speed limit. You have to drive five trillion, eight hundred million miles per year to get all the way across that fast.\n\n*	Scientists calculate that the Milky Way is 14 billion years old.\n\nThese little fun facts should get a pretty spirited discussion going about the origins of the universe and about the possibility of space travel or if there are life on other planets. You can challenge the kids to calculate that if every star in the Milky Way supported nine planets and if only one of them was habitable like earth is, what are the odds that life would exist on one of them? I think you will see some genuine excitement when they try to run those numbers.\n\nSuch discussion can be fun, exciting, and full of questions. Don’t be too hasty to shut down their imaginations as this is the birth of a lifelong love of astronomy that they are experiencing. And if you were there that first moment when they saw that night sky, you will re-experience your own great moment when you was a child. And it might set off a whole new excitement about astronomy in you all over again."},{title:"The Glossary Of Telescopes",body:"When you enter into any new area of science, you almost always find yourself with a baffling new language of technical terms to learn before you can converse with the experts. This is certainly true in astronomy both in terms of terms that refer to the cosmos and terms that describe the tools of the trade, the most prevalent being the telescope. So to get us off of first base, let’s define some of the key terms that pertain to telescopes to help you be able to talk to them more intelligently. \n\nThe first area of specialization in telescopes has to do with the types of telescopes people use. The three designs of telescopes that most people use are the Refractor, the Reflector and the Schmidt Cassegrain telescope. \n\n*	The refractor telescope uses a convex lens to focus the light on the eyepiece. \n\n*	The reflector telescope has a concave lens which means it bends in. It uses mirrors to focus the image that you eventually see. \n\n*	The Schmidt Cassegrain telescope uses an involved system of mirrors to capture the image you want to see.\n\n*	A binocular telescope uses a set of telescopes mounted and synchronized so your view of the sky is 3-D.\n\nBeyond the basic types, other terms refer to parts of the telescope or to the science behind how telescopes work.\n\n*	Collimation is a term for how well tuned the telescope is to give you a good clear image of what you are looking at. You want your telescope to have good collimation so you are not getting a false image of the celestial body.\n\n*	Aperture is a fancy word for how big the lens of your telescope is. But it’s an important word because the aperture of the lens is the key to how powerful your telescope is. Magnification has nothing to do with it, its all in the aperture.\n\n*	Focuser is the housing that keeps the eyepiece of the telescope, or what you will look through, in place. The focuser has to be stable and in good repair for you to have an image you can rely on.\n\n*	Mount and Wedge. Both of these terms refer to the tripod your telescope sits on. The mount is the actual tripod and the wedge is the device that lets you attach the telescope to the mount. The mount and the wedge are there to assist you with a superior viewing session and to keep your expensive telescope safe from a fall.\n\n*	An Altazimuth Mount refers to the tripod of the telescope that holds the device in place and makes it useful during a star gazing session. The altazimuth mouth allows the telescope to move both horizontally (which is the azimuth) and vertically. In this way you have full range to look at things close to the horizon or directly overhead.\n\n*	Coma has a different meaning than the one we are used to, and that’s a good thing. The coma is the blurry area on the outer rims of your view through the telescope. How big the coma is and to what extent it interferes with your viewing will have is important to the effectiveness of your telesscope.\n\n*	Planisphere. A fancy word for a star chart. It is nothing less or more than a detailed map of where everything is in the cosmos and how to find the star you wish to study by keying off of known stars.\n\n*	Barlow. This refers to a specialized type of lens that you can buy to enhance the magnification of your telescope. \n\nThese are just a few of the basic concepts of telescope operation. We deliberately picked the ones you have to know to discuss telescopes intelligently. But your education into the more complex aspects of astronomy and telescope design and operation will go on for as long as you are a lover of astronomy, which we hope is for the rest of your life."},{title:"Astronomy Binoculars A Great Alternative",body:"It seems from the moment you begin to take your love of astronomy seriously, the thing that is on your mind is what kind of telescope will you get. And there is no question, investing in a good telescope can really enhance your enjoyment of your new passion in astronomy. But don’t be too hasty to keep up with the big wigs in the astronomy clubs that have advanced telescopes. There is another alternative that can give you most of the advantages of a telescope and some extra flexibility and reduced cost to boot. That alternative is a good pair of astronomy binoculars. Mostly we think of binoculars as the thing you use to see the football game when you have to sit in the cheap seats. But if you do some homework and had a good grasp on what your stargazing objectives are, the advantages of astronomy binoculars over an entry level telescope can be pretty convincing.\n\n*	As a rule, they are cheaper. So you can get a lot of good stargazing at much less of an investment. You can always spend more money later but for now, this may be just the solution for you.\n\n*	There are not so many accessories. To own and operate a telescope takes a lot of orientation to how to set up and use the device. Beyond that, tuning it for optimum view and diagnosing it when you have problems can sometimes make the telescope more of the passion than stargazing itself.\n\n*	It is much easier to use. If you have not bought a telescope yet, you may have seen telescope owners going through a laborious set up and break down discipline for each use. This is time they are not looking at the stars. The binocular users are happily stargazing as this goes on.\n\n*	Binoculars are lightweight and portable. Unless you have the luxury to set up and operate an observatory from your deck, you are probably going to travel to perform your viewings. Binoculars go with you much easier and they are more lightweight to carry to the country and use while you are there than a cumbersome telescope set up kit.\n\nSo give the binocular option some consideration. To make the most effective choice, however, here are a few facts about astronomy binoculars that will help you evaluate which ones are best for you…\n\nBinoculars have two lens sets, one at the end of the eyepiece and a set right next to your eyes. The ones closest to the eye are called the ocular lenses which magnify the image (make it bigger). The ones closest to the sky are called the objective lenses and the size of these lenses will determine how much sky you can see at once. So anytime you are evaluating binoculars, there are two numbers associated with the set. So if the binoculars have a rating of 15-40, that means that the ocular lenses magnify 15 times and the later number is a relative number to how much of the sky you can see. The higher the second number, the more you can see. The explanation is simple. The bigger the lens, the more light it lets in. But be aware that the bigger the second number, the larger, heavier and more cumbersome the binoculars will be.\n\nYou will have to balance these two numbers with both your budget and what you want the binoculars to do for you. If you decide to go with a lower power binoculars, you could become frustrated with what you can see and you may have to take your eyes away from the view to get your orientation and consult the star map more often because your range of vision is so limited.\n\nThere will also be a temptation to buy a set of binoculars that have zoom functions and other features that will allow you to use it for other purposes such as hunting, whale watching or seeing the football game from the cheap seats. While this is good economy, those functions will get in the way when you are using the binoculars for astronomy. So if you are considering this purchase as your alternative to buying a telescope, our advice is buy binoculars made just for astronomy and don’t take them to the ball game."},{title:"Look Up In The Sky",body:"When television was young, there was a hugely popular show based on the still popular fictional character of Superman. The opening of that show had a familiar phrase that went, “Look. Up in the sky. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. It’s Superman!” How beloved Superman has become in our culture and the worldwide fascination with extraterrestrials and all things cosmic only emphasizes that there is a deep curiosity in all humans about nature and astronomy, even if many people would not know to call it astronomy.\n\nAstronomy is one of the oldest sciences of all time. When archeologists unearth ancient civilizations, even as far back as the cavemen, they invariably find art that shows mans unquenchable fascination with the stars. To this day, you can easily get an animated discussion at any gathering on the topic of “Is there intelligent life on other planets?” \n\nMany have tried to explain mankind’s seeming obsession with outer space as a result of an ancient memory or as part of mankind’s eternal nature. Whatever the cause, people of every age and every nation share this one deep interest, to know more about the universe that our tiny planet is just a part of.\n\nIt’s rather strange because the actual conduct of a serious student of astronomy is really not the stuff of high adventure. You will never see a “Raiders of the Lost Arc” or “Jurassic Park” movie made about an astronomer. Excitement for lovers of this science is to stay up all night watching the cosmos through a powerful telescope. But that fact does not seem to discourage the tens of thousands to get into astronomy each year and the huge interest worldwide with the stars, the planets and the universe.\n\nThere may be no other universal human fascination that does so much to make national boundaries and even international animosity seem to evaporate. Other than the Olympic movement, international cooperation to achieve great strides for human kind in space seems to go forward without interruption even when the nations cooperating in those projects are virtually at war back on the surface of the earth. It is a strange thing to watch as Russian, American and other astronauts work together like brothers on space missions even as their home nations are busily pointing missiles at each other back at home. It almost makes you think that we should put more energy and money into the space program, not less because it seems to be a bond that heals tension rather than creates it.\n\nWhy is astronomy so exciting even though we have no dinosaurs, moving animals or any real danger to most who are obsessed with the discipline? It may go back to a basic curiosity that all human beings have about their natural habitat and this big mysterious thing out there called space. Maybe it goes back to that old saying at the beginning of Star Trek that space is “the final frontier”. \n\nBut we all share that ongoing sense of excitement each time we take out our telescopes and gaze directly at the cosmos above us. We feel we are looking at the very dawn of time. And in light of the issues with the speed of light which means that many of the twinkling stars out there are really light from those stars that started their journey to us thousands of years ago, we are in actually looking directly at the past every time we direct our eyes skyward.\n\nBut we don’t have to worry about ever conquering the final frontier and finding our curiosity satisfied. There will always be more to learn and discover in the world of astronomy. And it is likely that mankind’s curiosity about astronomy is just as limitless as well."},{title:"Moon Fever",body:"Of all of the celestial bodies that capture our attention and fascination as astronomers, none has a greater influence on life on planet Earth than it’s own satellite, the moon. When you think about it, we regard the moon with such powerful significance that unlike the moons of other planets which we give names, we only refer to our one and only orbiting orb as THE moon. It is not a moon. To us, it is the one and only moon.\n\nThe moon works its way into our way of thinking, our feelings about romance, our poetry and literature and even how we feel about our day in day out lives in many cases. It is not only primitive societies that ascribe mood swings, changes in social conduct and changes in weather to the moon. Even today, a full moon can have a powerful effect on these forces which we acknowledge even if we cannot explain them scientifically.\n\nThe most obvious physical phenomenon that is directly affected by the gravity of the moon are the tides of the ocean. The tides are an integral part of how maritime life is regulated and the comings and goings of the fishing world in coastal communities. But not very many people know that at certain times of the year when the orbits of the earth bring the sun and moon into right alignment, there can even be tidal effect on inland bodies of water and even on the solid earth. Eons ago, when the moon’s orbit was closer to the Earth, it was the effect of the moon that caused massive changes in the topography of the land and on continental drift as well. This reflects the powerful effect the moon has had on both human history and on global geographical history as well.\n\nYou may sometimes wonder where the moon came from. Was it a planet that traveled too close to Earth and was captured in our orbit? Actually, the prevailing theory of modern science is that the moon was the result of a large scale collision with the still developing Earth early in its development which caused this large “chuck” to spin off into an orbiting body. This explains the similarity in composition as has been confirmed by many of the moon exploratory space missions that were conducted by NASA.\n\nBut this background also highlights another important influence the moon has had on Earth’s development that is seldom recognized and that is the stabilization of Earth’s orbital pattern. Most know that Earth is not round but more of an egg shaped orb. To be blunt, the Earth would wobble. Without the moon’s stabilizing influence, this shape would shift dramatically so the tilt of the axis, that is the polar caps would shift dramatically with each seasonal rotation producing climacteric, changes much more violent and drastic than we are used to. It is possible that life as we know it could not have developed here had the moon not been there to “keep the Earth in line” and continue to stabilize the orbital position of the Earth so our climate could remain stable and mild.\n\nA third significant influence of the moon comes from that origin as coming from a collision which “ripped” the body of the moon from the developing core of the Earth. Because of this disruption in how the core of our planet developed, the metals that are usually intact in the core of the planet are actually scattered up and down the geography of the earth in diverse ways. Usually the metals of the planet are all concentrated deep in the core. But because of the collision which took the moon out to orbit, metals that have been crucial to the development of our industrial and technological cultures are readily available and easy for use to mine. This again, is something we can thank the presence of that lovely moon in the sky for."},{title:"Dude You Re Getting A Telescope",body:"You might remember the Dell computer commercials in which a youth reports this exciting news to his friends that they are about to get their new computer by telling them, “Dude, you’re getting a Dell!” It was a cute series but it reflects the excitement young people get about anything new, particularly if it’s a new machine.\n\nSo when its time to finally get your children that very first telescope, you want to make sure it’s just the right thing. There are a number of reasons you should put some serious thought into just what this beginner telescope should look like. Perhaps this will be your children’s first experience with a real telescope. They may have a healthy and thriving love of astronomy from your family trips to the country to watch a meteor shower or just to gaze at the stars. And you may have piqued their interest showing them how to enhance the experience with binoculars or even letting them play with your telescope.\n\nBut this is a big moment. You want them to “bond” with this first telescope the way you did and catch the excitement of using the power of a telescope to do things with their love of astronomy that they could never do before. The reasons for taking care with your choice are many including…\n\n*	A telescope is a big step into the lifelong hobby of astronomy. If they get the wrong thing, frustration could make them lose interest both in the machine and in the field of study.\n\n*	Kids have a short attention span. You want this beginner telescope to take them from where they are to the next level while giving them those gratifying moments discovering new things in the stars every time they use it. \n\n*	It has to be a hardy piece of equipment. Kids don’t always know how to treat delicate equipment. So the starter telescope should have some good “training wheels” on it.\n\n*	It has to be their teacher even when they don’t know they are in school. A good beginner telescope, accompanied by some stimulating documentation that is written just for kids will stimulate their excitement and use it to teach them to work hard to reach new heights in their quest for knowledge about the stars.\n\nA lot about how you go about getting this first telescope will depend on your own expertise in astronomy. If it is your passion and you have developed a pretty sophisticated knowledge about telescopes over the years, you not only are well equipped to make this choice but you will be there to guide them as they begin to use it.\n\nBut if you are just encouraging them in a wonderful hobby that you yourself have not been involved with in depth, first of all, congratulations. You are giving them a wonderful gift of not only knowledge but the love of astronomy and the natural wonder of nature. But you also need some help. So here are some quick guidelines.\n\n*	Find the astronomy geeks. They are easy to find in hobby shops, astronomy clubs and societies at the local college. They will help you enthusiastically.\n\n*	Look at the telescope you are considering through their eyes. It should not be too complex. Don’t get something that will intimidate them.\n\n*	Don’t buy a toy. Your kids will know the difference.\n\n*	Make sure it can grow and be expanded as their knowledge expands.\n\nIf you put some wise consideration into just the right starter telescope, your kids will be as excited they have ever been for a gift. Don’t be surprised if you hear one of them squeal, “Dude, you got a telescope!”"
},{title:"Shooting Stars",body:"If you are a serious astronomy fanatic like a lot of us are, you can probably remember that one event in childhood that started you along this exciting hobby. It might have been that first time you looked through a telescope. But for many of us, it was that first time we saw a rain of fire from the sky that we eventually came to know as a meteoroid shower.\n\nAt the time when you see the first one, it’s easy to remember the movie “war of the worlds” or some other fantastic image of aliens entering our atmosphere in droves to take over the planet. But with some guidance and explanation of what was going on, we eventually learned that these showers were not at all threatening or any kind of invasion. For the most part meteoroid showers are harmless, part of nature and very fun to watch.\n\nSo what are these strange lights in the sky? Are they aliens invading from Mars? Are the comets coming to start the next ice age? Or perhaps asteroids burning up as they enter the earths atmosphere. The answer to the above questions is no to the first and “yes and no” to the other two.\n\nA meteoroid is actually a small piece of space rubble, usually dust or small rocks that come from either a comet or the break up of an asteroid in space and that eventually plummets toward the earth. We say “toward the earth” because the lights you see are the friction of the atmosphere burning up those small space tidbits and creating a spectacular show for all of us as they do so. A particularly exciting moment to witness is when a meteoroid breaks up or explodes on entry. A meteoroid that explodes is called bolides.\n\nThere are some interesting details about the life of a meteoroid that make the viewing of shooting stars even more fun. To be seen, a meteoroid only needs to weigh as little as a millionth of a gram. But the thing that makes them so spectacular to see is the tremendous speeds they reach as they enter the atmosphere. Before burning up, a meteoroid will reach between 11 and 74 kilometers per second which is 100 times faster than a speeding bullet.  We tend to think of t seeing a shooting star as a freak event and we associate it with superstition (hence, wish on a lucky star). But there are actually thousands of them every year so it really isn’t that rare to see one. In fact, scientists tell us that over 200,000 tons of space matter enters the atmosphere each year and burns up on entry. \n\nComets are a big source of meteoroids because of the nature of those long tails. A large amount of dust, ice and other space debris gets caught up in a comet’s tail as it moves toward the sun. Then as the comet moves away from the sun in its orbit, tons of this matter is thrown off into space to disperse. As the Earth moves in its routine orbit around the sun, it often crosses through clouds of this discarded matter which becomes one of those “meteor showers” that are so popular for viewing. \n\nThese showers of shooting stars are pretty easy for astronomers to predict so you can get into position to see the excitement at just the right time of night and be looking at the right area of the night sky. Usually the astronomy magazine or site will give you a general time and location to be ready to look when the meteoroids start to fall. \n\nNow keep in mind, this is a phenomenon of nature, so it may not observe the time table exactly. Also note that there is a notation system for where the meteoroid shower will occur based on what constellation is its backdrop. The section of the sky to focus on for the show is called the “radiant” because that is where the entering meteoroids begin to glow or radiate. The radiant is named for the constellation it is nearest too. So if the meteor shower is going to occur in the constellation of Leo, then its radiant will be called Leonid. This will help you decipher the listing of asteroid showers in the publications."},{title:"The Universe Through A Child S Eyes",body:"There is something about parenthood that gives us a sense of history and a deeply rooted desire to send on into the next generation the great things we have discovered about life. And part of that is the desire to instill in our children the love of science, of learning and particularly the love of nature. \n\nYour fascination with the universe and how to explore it as we so often do in the field of astronomy can be highly academic and dry as maybe it was if you took a course in astronomy. But when you get out there in the field at night, your equipment is just right and the night sky comes alive with activity, there is no other experience like it for majesty and pure excitement. And that is the kind of experience we want our children to come to love as much as we do.\n\nIt’s actually not a big jump from play to learning for children when it comes to learning about the natural world, science and astronomy. Exploration is a natural part of being a child and growing up in a fascinating world and universe. So if we can find ways to take that natural desire to explore and instill a life long passion for astronomy, we will have given our children a truly great gift.\n\nSo with a few simple family activities, we can instill that love of astronomy in our offspring. Here are some ideas.\n\n*	Make star gazing part of family life. You already love to go outdoors as often as possible to enjoy the stars. So don’t let that be your private passion. Get everybody into the act. The kids will love it and look forward to those nights as much as going to the circus.\n\n*	Make each new experience in growing into astronomy a fresh threshold. So the first experiences might be what you experienced as a kid, just laying on your back out in the country with the panorama of the stars overhead trying to take it all in. Go ahead and challenge them to count the stars. It’s a fun exercise and one they will save to use as a joke on their kids when they do this same thing in a few decades.\n\n*	Take them along the road of learning, introducing binoculars so they can focus on particular areas of the night sky.\n\n*	Now they are hooked and want to know about why some of the stars are brighter than others. They have no idea they are going to astronomy school and don’t even know it. You can tell them about the constellations as you point out how to find them by keying off the North Star. By being able to find things in that mass of stars and knowing there is such a vast amount more they can pick out, they are ripe for learning from star maps and about how the galaxies work. \n\n*	Think of their excitement as they notice the changes in the night sky. The phases of the moon and the effect of the rotation of the earth on the position of the planets. Help them find their favorite celestial bodies each night. Before long they will learn to chart the movement of the stars just like the early astronomers did.\n\n*	Now you will get caught up in the excitement of finding new things to reveal to your excited crew of fledgling astronomers. When you reveal that you are going on a safari to see an eclipse, a meteor shower or the once in a lifetime appearance of a comet, that gift will as big as anything you might spring on them for Christmas.\n\nThe wonders of the night sky will captivate your children the way it has you for years. And you will have done them the greatest favor you ever could do by making them lifelong lovers of the universe."},{title:"Astronomy Or Astrology",body:"Have you ever finally just gave in to the temptation and read your horoscope in the newspaper on Sunday morning? Sure, we all have. For most of us, it’s a curiosity, an amusement to see what they say our day will be like based on the sign of the zodiac that we were born under. Sometimes we forget that this little diversion is actually part of an ancient science called astrology that has had a powerful effect on many cultures dating back to centuries before Christ.\n\nThat is not to say that astrology is a dead art today. It is easy to find astrology advocates in every town, advertising in the newspaper and on television trying to convince us that they can tell our fortune, our future and help cure our ills by exploring the mysteries of astrology.\n\nWhen you are a lover of astronomy, the confusion between astronomy and astrology by those who don’t really understand the differences can get pretty aggravating. And in early civilizations, the two disciplines were not separate. Astrology was just the religious side of the science of astronomy. So what changed?\n\nThe most significant shift that set in motion the separation of the two lines of thought began in the first century when Ptolemy wrote the very first book on astronomy called the Tetrabiblos. In it, he began to suggest that astronomy should be considered a separate science from astrology. It was quite a revolutionary book because it also was the first scientific document to suggest that the earth was not the center of the universe and that astronomy should be focused strictly on the observation and recording of events in the cosmos.\n\nOver the next 2000 years, we have come a long way. Not only has science and religion completely gone their separate ways since Ptolemy but the science of astronomy makes tremendous strides every year that are so phenomenal, Ptolemy would be truly astounded.\n\nProbably the biggest point of diversion between a student of astrology and astronomy is the belief that the position of the stars has meaning over the events on our lives. Of course, we do know that the weather and tides and other important aspects of our lives are affected by the stars, planets and heavenly bodies, particularly the moon. But these things are happening because of completely explainable scientific laws in motion, not because of mystical forces at work.\n\nWhat can we, as devotees of astronomy conclude about the close relationship between astrology and astronomy? Well, for sure we want to be able to explain to anyone who is confused by the similarity in the words what the differences are. We do not want to see the two approaches to the stars and planets to become confused again. But we should do all we can do keep that distinction clear without becoming skeptical or demeaning towards those who may still hold to the teachings of astrology.\n\nIt is important to remember that what is part of a person’s religious life has a level of sacred belief to the one holding it. And it is not respectful to scoff at such things. If for no other reason than out of respect for the ancient origins of astronomy, we should give courtesy who still are exploring whether astrology has any validity for them.\n\nIf we can treat each discipline with respect but maintain the separation that must exist between astrology and astronomy, there is no reason both approaches to our admiration of the galaxies cannot coexist in peace and harmony. And for our purposes as astronomers, that harmony will allow us plenty of freedom to enjoy our quest for knowledge for many more centuries to come. And who knows, you might still like to read the horoscope on Sunday morning every so often."},{title:"The Basics Of Buying A Telescope",body:"There is a moment in the life of any aspiring astronomer that it is time to buy that first telescope. It’s exciting to think about setting up your own viewing station whether that is on the deck of your home or having a powerful but mobile telescope set up to take to the remove countryside to really get a good shot at some breath taking star gazing.\n\nThe last thing we would want to do is to take away any of the “fun” of your hobby of astronomy because the joy of what we do as star gazers is a big part of the appeal. But unlike many other hobbies, ours is a passion of science, of learning and of discovery. And don’t kid yourself, even a hobbyist with a limited telescopic set up can see some amazing things in the stars. So let’s be sure you invest in a solid piece of equipment that you can continue to grow with as your knowledge and ability as an astronomer grows. But how do we do that?\n\nMeet the Geeks.\n\nNow we use the term “telescope geeks” lovingly because any of us who are devoted to our love of astronomy eventually become telescope geeks. And these are the type of people who will know exactly how to evaluate your needs in terms of where you are right now and where you want to go as your hobby grows with you. So if you have not yet associated with a local astronomy club, now is the time to do it. \n\nStart rubbing elbows with people who live and breathe telescopes. Their input is a hundred times more reliable than what a sales brochure or that salesman might have to say because the “telescope geeks” have been where you are, made the mistakes and are eager to help you avoid those same mistakes.\n\nSize Matters\n\nIn the world of telescopes, the sales people see, to try to baffle us with all the bells and whistles of their hottest selling model. One of the big check points that is often pushed is the amplification level of the telescope lens. While that is a factor that is worth noting, when it comes to a telescope lens, the old phrase “size matters” is a good guideline.\n\nJust remember that your telescope lens works best when it takes in the most light it can from the object you are viewing. So the wider the diameter of the lens, the better a view you are going to get. So don’t fall for the amplification level only. Carefully evaluate the lens size so you have the right fit for what you want to do.\n\nIt Has to Stand on Its Own Feet.\n\nIf you are going to set up a permanent telescope station, then you can bolt the unit down so it is well supported. But many of us have to take our telescopes out into the country for optimum use. So the stand has to be strong and flexible so we can set up the telescope on uneven turf but still feel secure that this important and expensive piece of equipment is going to stand on its own without fear of it falling during our observation time. \n\nWe already mentioned strong and flexible as evaluation guides for the telescope stand but add in ease of use as well. You have to be able to set your telescope up and break it down quickly and easily when you are on a remote viewing. You may even find yourself setting up or taking down your telescope in the dark or by lantern or flashlight if you are taking advantage of the great star displays in the late night sky that make this hobby so exciting. \n\nThese are the basics of what to look for in your new telescope. Finally, make sure the telescope can be enhanced and expanded without having to throw the first unit away and buy something completely new. You want your telescope to grow as your knowledge and skills grow. If your first telescope meets all of these requirements, you are off on the right foot on a long and enjoyable career as an amateur astronomer."},{title:"Asteroids",body:"There is a lot of exciting stuff going on in the stars above us that make astronomy so much fun. The truth is the universe is a constantly changing, moving, some would say “living” thing because you just never know what you are going to see on any given night of stargazing.\n\nBut of the many celestial phenomenons, there is probably none as exciting as that time you see your first asteroid on the move in the heavens. To call asteroids the “rock stars” of astronomy is simultaneously a bad joke but an accurate depiction of how astronomy fans view them. Unlike suns, planets and moons, asteroids are on the move, ever changing and, if they appear in the night sky, exciting and dynamic.\n\nLike rock stars, asteroids have been given their fair share of urban myth and lore. Many have attributed the extinction of the dinosaurs to the impact of a huge asteroid on the earth. This theory has some credibility and, if it is true, it evokes some pretty startling images and foreboding fears in the current reining species on earth, the human race.\n\nThe fact that asteroids are fast moving space debris only makes their movement and activity more interesting and exciting. Unlike a moon, planet or star, the odds that an asteroid could hit the earth are entirely reasonable and in fact, there are many documented cases of small asteroids making it through our atmosphere and leaving some pretty impressive craters in the earth’s surface.\n\nPopular culture has happily embraced the idea of an asteroid impact. The idea has spawned many a science fiction story adding the idea that alien life forms may ride asteroids to our world and start a “war of the worlds” situation. But by far, the most talked about concept that has captured the imagination and the fears of science fiction fans and the general public is of another asteroid hitting the earth that could wipe out life as allegedly happened to the dinosaurs. In fact, the movie “Armageddon” was based on this idea and the concept that somehow mankind could avert that catastrophe with technology.\n\nBut probably the best way to calm our fears and replace science fiction with science is with understanding and knowledge. The truth is, there has been a lot of study of asteroid activity and the serious scientific community has gained significant knowledge of these amazing celestial bodies. A number of probes to asteroids have been conducted which have given us a wealth of information about their composition and how we might predict their behavior. \n\nWe now know that the majority of asteroids we get to witness come from an asteroid belt that exists between Mars and Jupiter. It is from this community of asteroids that many of the notable asteroids emerged. Scientists have gained significant knowledge about the composition of asteroids and separated them into classes including class S which comes of the part of the belt that is closest to Mars, classes C, D and V which are classified by composition and a class called “Centaurs” whose flight patterns take them closer to Jupiter and Uranus.\n\nSome of the probes NASA has conducted on near flying asteroids have performed some pretty amazing studies of these eccentric celestial bodies. In 1994 the Galileo probe got within 1000 miles of the asteroid Ida and discovered that Ida actually had its own moon. \n\nOther probes have fired impactors into asteroids and even landed on an asteroid to produce some amazing scientific data for us. There is much to learn about asteroids in our love of astronomy and that knowledge only makes our enjoyment of seeing them in the cosmos even more exciting."},{title:"The Amazing Hubble",body:"In the history of modern astronomy, there is probably no one greater leap forward than the building and launch of the space telescope known as the Hubble. While NASA has had many ups and downs, the launch and continued operation of the Hubble space telescope probably ranks next to the moon landings and the development of the Space Shuttle as one of the greatest space exploration accomplishments of the last hundred years.\n\nAn amazing piece of astronomy trivia that few people know is that in truth, only about ten percent of the universe is visible using conventional methods of observation. For that reason, the Hubble really was a huge leap forward. That is for the very simple reason that the Hubble can operate outside of the atmosphere of Earth. Trying to make significant space exploration via telescopes from the terrestrial surface of planet Earth is very difficult. That very thing that keeps us alive, our own Earth’s atmosphere presents a serious distraction from being able to see deeper and further into space.\n\nThe Hubble space telescope was named after the great scientist and visionary Edward Hubble who discovered that the universe was expanding which was explained by what is now known in science as Hubble’s Law. To truly get a feel for the amazing accomplishment that was achieved with the launch of the Hubble telescope, spend some time on Nasa’s web site dedicated to the project at http://hubble.nasa.gov. There are also a number of sites where you can enjoy some stunning pictures from the Hubble including http://heritage.stsci.edu/ and http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/hdf.html. It’s hard to believe how long the Hubble has been orbiting earth and sending back amazing video and pictures of what it is discovering in space. But the Hubble was actually initially launched on April 25th 1990. It was the culmination of literally decades of research and construction which began in 1977. Expectations were high as the orbiting telescope was put in place and actually began to function as it was designed to do.\n\nAll was not always perfect with the telescope and the early pictures were disappointing. After some study NASA discovered that the reason for the early failures was the curvatures of one of the main lenses of the orbiting telescope.\n\nWe probably could never have kept this intricate piece of equipment operational as well as we have had we not had the Space Shuttle program to give us a tool to implement repairs and improvements to the Hubble. In 1993 a new lens was installed on the Hubble which corrected the problem of picture resolution that was noted in the early operation of the telescope.\n\nTwo other repair and upgrade mission have been made to the Hubble since it launched, both of them in 1997 to upgrade older equipment and to retrofit the telescope to extend its useful life through 2010. It’s pretty amazing to think that this scientific and mechanical marvel has been operating now for ten years without maintenance. We can be assured that plans are in the works for NASA to upgrade or replace parts on the Hubble to extend its useful life even further as that 2010 time frame draws closer. \n\nIt is hard to imagine the science of astronomy or the natural quest for greater knowledge of our universe without the Hubble. While many times those who would not fund space exploration have tried to cut funding for the Hubble, the operation of this telescope is just too important to astronomers and to the scientific well being of mankind and our planet not to continue to use the Hubble, or its next natural successor. We will always need to have a set of eyes in the sky to watch the universe and discover more of its mysteries."},{title:"Telescopes 101",body:"Buying the right telescope to take your love of astronomy to the next level is a big next step in the development of your passion for the stars. In many ways, it is a big step from someone who is just fooling around with astronomy to a serious student of the science. But you and I both know that there is still another big step after buying a telescope before you really know how to use it.\n\nSo it is critically important that you get just the right telescope for where you are and what your star gazing preferences are. To start with, let’s discuss the three major kinds of telescopes and then lay down some “Telescope 101″ concepts to increase your chances that you will buy the right thing.\n\nThe three primary types of telescopes that the amateur astronomer might buy are the Refractor, the Reflector and the Schmidt Cassegrain telescope. The first two are named for the kind of lens that is used. It is pretty easy to see that the lens is the heart of the telescope so the kind that you will use will determine the success of your use of that telescope.\n\nThe refractor lens is the simplest because it uses a convex lens to focus the light on the eyepiece. So the lens bends outwards for this purpose. The refractor telescope’s strength is in viewing planets. The reflector’s strength is in seeing more distant objects and the lens is concave or bends in. It uses mirrors to focus the image that you eventually see. The final type, the Schmidt Cassegrain telescope is the most complex and accomplishes the goals of both but it uses an involved system of mirrors to capture the image you want to see.\n\nSo to select just the right kind of telescope, your objectives in using the telescope are important. To really understand the strengths and weaknesses not only of the lenses and telescope design but also in how the telescope performs in various star gazing situations, it is best to do some homework up front and get exposure to the different kinds. So before you make your first purchase…\n\n*	Above all, establish a relationship with a reputable telescope shop that employs people who know their stuff. If you buy your telescope at a Wal-Mart or department store, the odds you will get the right thing are remote.\n\n*	Pick the brains of the experts. If you are not already active in an astronomy society or club, the sales people at the telescope store will be able to guide you to the active societies in your area. Once you have connections with people who have bought telescopes, you can get advice about what works and what to avoid that is more valid than anything you will get from a web article or a salesperson at Wal-Mart.\n\n*	Try before you buy. This is another advantage of going on some field trips with the astronomy club. You can set aside some quality hours with people who know telescopes and have their rigs set up to examine their equipment, learn the key technical aspects, and try them out before you sink money in your own set up.\n\nThere are other considerations to factor into your final purchase decision. How mobile must your telescope be? The tripod or other accessory decisions will change significantly with a telescope that will live on your deck versus one that you plan to take to many remote locations. Along those lines, how difficult is the set up and break down? How complex is the telescope and will you have trouble with maintenance? Network to get the answers to these and other questions. If you do your homework like this, you will find just the right telescope for this next big step in the evolution of your passion for astronomy."},{title:"Radio Astronomy",body:"For most of us, the idea of astronomy is something we directly connect to “stargazing”, telescopes and seeing magnificent displays in the heavens. And to be sure, that is the exciting area of astronomy that accounts for it’s huge popularity. So to the uninitiated, the idea of “radio astronomy” seems strange. There are two reasons for that. First is that humans are far more visual than audio oriented. And the second is that radio astronomy doesn’t really involve “listening” to the cosmos except to the extent that scientists who use this sophisticated form of “stargazing” do not rely on visual study to conduct their work.\n\nTo appreciate what is really exciting about radio astronomy, first we have to shift how we view astronomy. That is because to professional astronomers, studying the universe is more about frequencies than it is about visual documentation of phenomenon. This takes us back to Physics 101.\n\nLight, obviously, is the physical phenomenon that empowers our ability to use our visual confirmation system, e.g. our eyes to appreciate something, in this case the stars. So when we look up at the heavens, we can see the light emitting from a star or reflecting from a planet or moon. In many cases, if we see a far away star, we are actually seeing it hundreds or thousands of years ago because that is how long it takes for that light to cross the universe and be visible in our sky. That alone is a pretty mind blowing idea.\n\nNow light itself is a pretty strange substance. But to our astronomy scientists, light is just another energy that exists in a certain frequency. Now, we tend to think of frequencies when we talk about sound waves. In scientific terms light, energy and sound are just a few forms of the same thing, frequencies of energy that are emulating from a source. \n\nNow we get to why radio astronomy is so necessary. The range of frequency that light occupies in the big spectrum of frequencies is really pretty small. To put that more bluntly, we can only “see” a tiny part of the universe that is actually there. Now when you look up in the night sky and it is so overwhelming, when you then that we are seeing just a tiny amount of what is actually going on up there, again, our minds can get pretty overwhelmed.\n\nRadio astronomy uses sophisticated sensor equipment to study ALL of the frequencies of energy coming to us from the cosmos. In that way, these scientists can “see” everything that is going on out there and so get a precise idea of how the stars look, behave now and will behave in the future.\n\nFor some of us who have heard about radio astronomy, we think of it in terms of “listening” for signs of life in the universe. And yes, SETI, or “the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence” is a part of radio astronomy, albeit a tiny part. But of much greater importance is how radio astronomy has empowered serious astronomers (that is those who get paid to do it) to study stars many light years away, to study black holes which we could never see with our telescopes and to gather research and data about the whole of the universe that otherwise would be impossible to know and understand.\n\nThis is important work that is constantly ongoing in the world of astronomy. It is worth keeping up with and learning more about as we have barely scratched the surface in our brief discussion today. But understanding how important radio astronomy is will only deepen and make more meaningful your love and grasp of this big field of knowledge known as astronomy."},{title:"Moon Gazing",body:"For many of us, our very first experience of learning about the celestial bodies begins when we saw our first full moon in the sky. It is truly a magnificent view even to the naked eye. If the night is clear, you can see amazing detail of the lunar surface just star gazing on in your back yard.\n\nNaturally, as you grow in your love of astronomy, you will find many celestial bodies fascinating. But the moon may always be our first love because is the one far away space object that has the unique distinction of flying close to the earth and upon which man has walked.\n\nYour study of the moon, like anything else, can go from the simple to the very complex. To gaze at the moon with the naked eye, making yourself familiar with the lunar map will help you pick out the seas, craters and other geographic phenomenon that others have already mapped to make your study more enjoyable. Moon maps can be had from any astronomy shop or online and they are well worth the investment.\n\nThe best time to view the moon, obviously, is at night when there are few clouds and the weather is accommodating for a long and lasting study. The first quarter yields the greatest detail of study. And don’t be fooled but the blotting out of part of the moon when it is not in full moon stage. The phenomenon known as “earthshine” gives you the ability to see the darkened part of the moon with some detail as well, even if the moon is only at quarter or half display.\n\nTo kick it up a notch, a good pair of binoculars can do wonders for the detail you will see on the lunar surface. For best results, get a good wide field in the binocular settings so you can take in the lunar landscape in all its beauty. And because it is almost impossible to hold the binoculars still for the length of time you will want to gaze at this magnificent body in space, you may want to add to your equipment arsenal a good tripod that you can affix the binoculars to so you can study the moon in comfort and with a stable viewing platform.\n\nOf course, to take your moon worship to the ultimate, stepping your equipment up to a good starter telescope will give you the most stunning detail of the lunar surface. With each of these upgrades your knowledge and the depth and scope of what you will be able to see will improve geometrically. For many amateur astronomers, we sometimes cannot get enough of what we can see on this our closest space object. \n\nTo take it to a natural next level, you may want to take advantage of partnerships with other astronomers or by visiting one of the truly great telescopes that have been set up by professionals who have invested in better techniques for eliminating atmospheric interference to see the moon even better. The internet can give you access to the Hubble and many of the huge telescopes that are pointed at the moon all the time. Further, many astronomy clubs are working on ways to combine multiple telescopes, carefully synchronized with computers for the best view of the lunar landscape.\n\nBecoming part of the society of devoted amateur astronomers will give you access to these organized efforts to reach new levels in our ability to study the Earth’s moon. And it will give you peers and friends who share your passion for astronomy and who can share their experience and areas of expertise as you seek to find where you might look next in the huge night sky, at the moon and beyond it in your quest for knowledge about the seemingly endless universe above us."
},{title:"Beyond The Naked Eye",body:"It’s hard to say when in our lives each of us become aware of this thing called “astronomy”. But it is safe to say that at some point on our lives, each and every one of us has that moment when we are suddenly stunned when we come face to face with the enormity of the universe that we see in the night sky. For many of us who are city dwellers, we don’t really notice that sky up there on a routine basis. The lights of the city do a good job of disguising the amazing display that is above all of our heads all of the time.\n\nSo it might be that once a year vacation to a camping spot or a trip to a relative’s house out in the country that we find ourselves outside when the spender of the night sky suddenly decides to put on it’s spectacular show. If you have had that kind of moment when you were literally struck breathless by the spender the night sky can show to us, you can probably remember that exact moment when you could say little else but “wow” at what you saw.\n\nThat “Wow” moment is what astrology is all about. For some, that wow moment becomes a passion that leads to a career studying the stars. For a lucky few, that wow moment because an all consuming obsession that leads to them traveling to the stars in the space shuttle or on one of our early space missions. But for most of us astrology may become a pastime or a regular hobby. But we carry that wow moment with us for the rest of our lives and begin looking for ways to look deeper and learn more about the spectacular universe we see in the millions of stars above us each night.\n\nTo get started in learning how to observe the stars much better, there are some basic things we might need to look deeper, beyond just what we can see with the naked eye and begin to study the stars as well as enjoy them. The first thing you need isn’t equipment at all but literature. A good star map will show you the major constellations, the location of the key stars we use to navigate the sky and the planets that will appear larger than stars. And if you add to that map some well done introductory materials into the hobby of astronomy, you are well on your way.\n\nThe next thing we naturally want to get is a good telescope. You may have seen a hobbyist who is well along in their study setting up those really cool looking telescopes on a hill somewhere. That excites the amateur astronomer in you because that must be the logical next step in the growth of your hobby. But how to buy a good telescope can be downright confusing and intimidating.\n\nBefore you go to that big expense, it might be a better next step from the naked eye to invest in a good set of binoculars. There are even binoculars that are suited for star gazing that will do just as good a job at giving you that extra vision you want to see just a little better the wonders of the universe. A well designed set of binoculars also gives you much more mobility and ability to keep your “enhanced vision” at your fingertips when that amazing view just presents itself to you.\n\nNone of this precludes you from moving forward with your plans to put together an awesome telescope system. Just be sure you get quality advice and training on how to configure your telescope to meet your needs. Using these guidelines, you will enjoy hours of enjoyment stargazing at the phenomenal sights in the night sky that are beyond the naked eye."},{title:"Space The Final Frontier",body:"While it was just a TV show, that little speech at the beginning of the original Star Trek show really did do a good job of capturing our feelings about space. It is those feelings that drive our love of astronomy and our desire to learn more and more about it. \n\nThe thing that is most exciting about studying the universe is also the most frustrating and that is that no matter how expert we get, we are always just getting started. But if it’s any consolation, some of the most advanced minds in science and from history always felt that way about space. Even the greats such as Copernicus and Einstein looked up into space and felt like they were just a spec in the presence of such infinity.\n\nOf course space is not infinite. It has to be finite which means somehow there must be an end to it. But if there is, nobody on this tiny planet has figured out where it is. The only thing that has brought us to “the end of the universe” is our limited ability to see any deeper into space. \n\nBut conquering the final frontier of space means more than just seeing more stars and planets and building the biggest telescope we can. There are some mind blowing concepts about how space works that we have ahead of us to conquer. The big bang and the expanding universe alone was enough to set your mind to spinning. But then we have the coming of Einstein and the theory of relativity to set the entire idea on its ear. All of a sudden space is not just three dimensions but the dimension of time becomes exportable and the twisting and maybe even travel through time seems almost possible.\n\nThe frontier of space is as much a journey of the mind as it is of distance. When Steven Hawking showed us the mysteries of black holes, all of a sudden, time and space could collapse and be twisted and changed in those intergalactic pressure cookers. If not for the wonders of radio astronomy, these ideas would remain just ideas but slowly science is catching up with theory.\n\nBut the brilliance of mathematicians and genius minds like Hawking and Einstein continue to stretch our concepts of space. Now we have the string theory that could revolutionize everything we know about space, time and how the universe relates to itself. We can’t just say, no, we have discovered enough. It’s the final frontier. The Starship Enterprise would not stop exploring so neither can we. Because there is a hurdle still ahead that has a name but no real answer to it yet. It’s called the Unified Field Theory and those that know tell us that when the Einsteins and Hawkings of our day crack that theory, every other theory will fall into place.\n\nThese exciting concepts seem some tools to put the enormity of space in context. That may also be the value of science fiction. Not only are science fiction writers often the visionaries of what comes to be in the future but they give us the idea that space is knowable, that despite how big it is and how small we are, we can conquer this frontier like we have conquered others before us.\n\nFor mankind, that is often enough. If we can get the vision that we can conquer something, even if it is something so massive, so impossibly huge, it seems that we are capable of anything. And the love of astronomy, maybe unlike any other force on earth, has brought together mankind toward that common goal of conquering the universe. The quest to establish an international space station and to cooperate on spreading our reach off of this planet seems to find commonality between nations that otherwise cannot get along on the surface of the earth.\n\nThat alone may be a reason that we must continue to support astronomy locally and the space program nationally. It is something that seems to bring peace rather than war and make us a better people. But more than that it is as though this is what we were created to do. To reach out to the stars may be our destiny. If so then our love of astronomy is more than a hobby, it’s a calling."},{title:"Pictures In The Sky",body:"One of the earliest activities we engaged in when we first got into astronomy is the same one we like to show our children just as soon as their excitement about the night sky begins to surface. That is the fun of finding constellations. But finding constellations and using them to navigate the sky is a discipline that goes back virtually to the dawn of man. In fact, we have cave pictures to show that the more primitive of human societies could “see pictures” in the sky and ascribe to them significance.\n\nConstellations also have been important in culture and navigation long before we had sophisticated systems of navigation. Early explorers, particularly by sea, relied exclusively on the night sky to help them find their way to their destination. In fact, when “Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492″ and “discovered” America, he could not have done it without astronomy and the help of navigation of the cosmos, much of which is made possible because of the important constellations. \n\nWhen learning to find the great constellations in the sky, we use the “find one, you found them all” system. That is because the easiest constellation to find will guide us to the rest of them. That constellation is The Big Dipper. Look to the northern sky on a clear night and widen your field of vision from just focusing on one star and it will pretty much jump out at you. In will look like a big kitchen pot or ladle, right side up in the fall, upside down in the spring.\n\nWhen you have the big dipper under control, you can pretty easily find the North Star. This is the star that those ancient sailors depended on the most to find their way to land. Start with the far edge of the bowl of the Big Dipper, the side that is opposite the handle. There are two stars that make up that side of the bowl. So start at the bottom of the pot and mentally draw a line to the top star of the bowl. These two stars are “pointing” to the North Star. Just keep following that line, curving a bit with the sky and the bright star that you come to is the North Star. You can impress your friends or family if you know the scientific name for this star is Polaris.\n\nThe North Star can then take you to The Little Dipper. The key here is that Polaris is the tip of the handle of The Little Dipper and the bowl hangs down from the handle like it was hanging up in the kitchen. Be patient with this one as the stars that make up The Little Dipper are dimmer than The Big Dipper. But it pretty cool once you find it.\n\nThese are the obvious starting places but from The Little Dipper you can find the constellation known as “The Swan” or Cygnus. Just use the same system you used to find The North Star but continue drawing that line that started in those pointer stars in the bowl of The Big Dipper. Go about half as far as you went to find Polaris and you are there. You will see a trapezoid of stars about as big as The Big Dipper. This trapezoid forms the tail of The Swan.\n\nThat line that we are drawing from the pointer stars is our roadmap to another well known constellation which is Cassiopeia. If you use that line and imagine you are directly under the two pointer stars, you will se a big “W” just off to the left of the line. This is the constellation Cassiopeia, the wife of the king of Egypt, Cepheus, in Greek mythology. There are so many more wonderful constellations to find and a good star map can continue your quest.\n\nLike Cassiopeia, all of the constellations have wonderful stories and myths related to Greek culture. It is just as fun to find the star clusters themselves as it is to enjoy the rich culture related to that constellation. For all of the signs of the zodiac, for example, there is a related constellation in the sky. So whether you are serious about astrology or not, its fun to find the constellation that relates to your “sign” (or that of your children) and be able to see how the ancients related to these pictures in the sky."},{title:"How To Look Up",body:"The beauty of astronomy is that anybody can do it. From the tiniest baby to the most advanced astrophysicist, there is something for anyone who wants to enjoy astronomy. In fact, it is a science that is so accessible that virtually anybody can do it virtually anywhere they are. All they have to know how to do is to look up.\n\nIt really is amazing when you think about it that just by looking up on any given night, you could see virtually hundreds of thousands of stars, star systems, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and maybe a even an occasional space shuttle might wander by. It is even more breathtaking when you realize that the sky you are looking up at is for all intents and purposes the exact same sky that our ancestors hundreds and thousands of years ago enjoyed when they just looked up.\n\nThere is something timeless about the cosmos. The fact that the planets and the moon and the stars beyond them have been there for ages does something to our sense of our place in the universe. In fact, many of the stars we “see” with our naked eye are actually light that came from that star hundreds of thousands of years ago. That light is just now reaching the earth. So in a very real way, looking up is like time travel.\n\nEverybody knows how to look up. Children first discover the amazing light show on display for free every clear night by just looking up. You can probably remember that very first time you noticed that explosion of stars above you when you were a child. Now it is time to foster that same love of astronomy in your own children. You have to teach them how to look up.\n\nWhile anyone can look up and fall in love with the stars at any time, the fun of astronomy is learning how to become more and more skilled and equipped in star gazing that you see and understand more and more each time you look up. Here are some steps you can take to make the moments you can devote to your hobby of astronomy much more enjoyable.\n\n*	Get out of town. The furtherest you can get from the lights of the city, the more you will see in the night sky.\n\n*	Know what you are looking at. It is great fun to start learning the constellations, how to navigate the night sky and find the planets and the famous stars. There are web sites and books galore to guide you.\n\n*	Get some history. Learning the background to the great discoveries in astronomy will make your moments star gazing more meaningful. It is one of the oldest sciences on earth so find out the greats of history who have looked at these stars before you.\n\n*	Get a geek. Astronomy clubs are lively places full of knowledgeable amateurs who love to share their knowledge with you. For the price of a coke and snacks, they will go star gazing with you and overwhelm you with trivia and great knowledge.\n\n*	Know when to look. Not only knowing the weather will make sure your star gazing is rewarding but if you learn when the big meteor showers and other big astronomy events will happen will make the excitement of astronomy come alive for you.\n\nAnd when all is said and done, get equipped. Your quest for newer and better telescopes will be a lifelong one. Let yourself get addicted to astronomy and the experience will enrich every aspect of life. It will be an addiction you never want to break."},{title:"What If They Let You Run The Hubble",body:"It is probably the dream of any amateur astronomer to be able to be the boss of one of the great multi million dollar telescopes even if it was just for one hour or for a few shots. Sure, we can have a lot of fun with our binoculars. And as we improve our personal equipment set, we get better and better at pinpointing what we want to see in the sky.\n\nBut there is only so far we can go within the constraints of a family budget in building the perfect telescopic operation. Probably the next level then is to work together with others in your astronomy club. By pooling our resources, we can make more progress both in acquiring much more sophisticated equipment and in synchronizing our telescopic operations.\n\nAll of this is good and its fun to tweak it and play with it always finding improvements. But when we are sitting back and dreaming, it’s those big institutional size telescopes that really grab our interest. Maybe you have had a chance to visit one at Kitt Peak, Arizona, Mauna Kea, Hawaii, Palomar Mountain, California or Mt. Locke, Texas to name just a few and as you walked around jaw dropped to your shoes, you thought, maybe if I could just run it for an hour, how awesome would that be?\n\nThe good news is that while these huge observatories are not going to let you come in and turn the gears of the mightiest telescopes yourself, many of them will perform specific observations for you and allow you to “see through their eyes” via the internet for that short observation. This is a powerful option for an amateur astronomer and one you want to prepare for carefully. Here is what you do…\n\n1.	Begin compiling a list of the great telescopes of the world, their locations and how to contact them. Google will help you with finding lists of these observatories to contact by pointing you to specific directory sites like http://astro.nineplanets.org/bigeyes.html 2.	You can start by submitting your request to a specific observatory. Now here is where you have to do your homework. If you have a specific celestial event you wish to observe, there will be particular telescopes around the globe that will be in the best position to get those shots for you. So study up and find just the right telescope and when the perfect moment for that observation would occur. Get out ahead of this homework as you need to submit your request in plenty of time for it to go through approval and for them to get back to you and to interact with you to nail down what you are going to have them look at.\n\n3.	There are two ways you can direct the operators of the telescopes. You can give them specific coordinates to focus on and a specific time frame to perform the observation. The other way is to give them a star, a planet or a particular star system to observe and let them figure out the coordinates. That might be easier because you know what you want to see.\n\n4.	Now you sit back and wait for the email that the observation is done. You will not be able to watch them do the observation dynamically. That would be nice but it just isn’t possible yet. These are telescopes, not web cams. But they will post the pictures from your observation on a particular web location and email the results to you for study.\n\nIt’s pretty cool, free and customized to what you requested. And you can brag to your friends as you make color copies of your shots that you had Kitt Peak do these up for you personally. And you would not be lying."},{title:"Astronomy Or Astrology",body:"Have you ever finally just gave in to the temptation and read your horoscope in the newspaper on Sunday morning? Sure, we all have. For most of us, it’s a curiosity, an amusement to see what they say our day will be like based on the sign of the zodiac that we were born under. Sometimes we forget that this little diversion is actually part of an ancient science called astrology that has had a powerful effect on many cultures dating back to centuries before Christ.\n\nThat is not to say that astrology is a dead art today. It is easy to find astrology advocates in every town, advertising in the newspaper and on television trying to convince us that they can tell our fortune, our future and help cure our ills by exploring the mysteries of astrology.\n\nWhen you are a lover of astronomy, the confusion between astronomy and astrology by those who don’t really understand the differences can get pretty aggravating. And in early civilizations, the two disciplines were not separate. Astrology was just the religious side of the science of astronomy. So what changed?\n\nThe most significant shift that set in motion the separation of the two lines of thought began in the first century when Ptolemy wrote the very first book on astronomy called the Tetrabiblos. In it, he began to suggest that astronomy should be considered a separate science from astrology. It was quite a revolutionary book because it also was the first scientific document to suggest that the earth was not the center of the universe and that astronomy should be focused strictly on the observation and recording of events in the cosmos.\n\nOver the next 2000 years, we have come a long way. Not only has science and religion completely gone their separate ways since Ptolemy but the science of astronomy makes tremendous strides every year that are so phenomenal, Ptolemy would be truly astounded.\n\nProbably the biggest point of diversion between a student of astrology and astronomy is the belief that the position of the stars has meaning over the events on our lives. Of course, we do know that the weather and tides and other important aspects of our lives are affected by the stars, planets and heavenly bodies, particularly the moon. But these things are happening because of completely explainable scientific laws in motion, not because of mystical forces at work.\n\nWhat can we, as devotees of astronomy conclude about the close relationship between astrology and astronomy? Well, for sure we want to be able to explain to anyone who is confused by the similarity in the words what the differences are. We do not want to see the two approaches to the stars and planets to become confused again. But we should do all we can do keep that distinction clear without becoming skeptical or demeaning towards those who may still hold to the teachings of astrology.\n\nIt is important to remember that what is part of a person’s religious life has a level of sacred belief to the one holding it. And it is not respectful to scoff at such things. If for no other reason than out of respect for the ancient origins of astronomy, we should give courtesy who still are exploring whether astrology has any validity for them.\n\nIf we can treat each discipline with respect but maintain the separation that must exist between astrology and astronomy, there is no reason both approaches to our admiration of the galaxies cannot coexist in peace and harmony. And for our purposes as astronomers, that harmony will allow us plenty of freedom to enjoy our quest for knowledge for many more centuries to come. And who knows, you might still like to read the horoscope on Sunday morning every so often."},{title:"The Basics Of Buying A Telescope",body:"There is a moment in the life of any aspiring astronomer that it is time to buy that first telescope. It’s exciting to think about setting up your own viewing station whether that is on the deck of your home or having a powerful but mobile telescope set up to take to the remove countryside to really get a good shot at some breath taking star gazing.\n\nThe last thing we would want to do is to take away any of the “fun” of your hobby of astronomy because the joy of what we do as star gazers is a big part of the appeal. But unlike many other hobbies, ours is a passion of science, of learning and of discovery. And don’t kid yourself, even a hobbyist with a limited telescopic set up can see some amazing things in the stars. So let’s be sure you invest in a solid piece of equipment that you can continue to grow with as your knowledge and ability as an astronomer grows. But how do we do that?\n\nMeet the Geeks.\n\nNow we use the term “telescope geeks” lovingly because any of us who are devoted to our love of astronomy eventually become telescope geeks. And these are the type of people who will know exactly how to evaluate your needs in terms of where you are right now and where you want to go as your hobby grows with you. So if you have not yet associated with a local astronomy club, now is the time to do it. \n\nStart rubbing elbows with people who live and breathe telescopes. Their input is a hundred times more reliable than what a sales brochure or that salesman might have to say because the “telescope geeks” have been where you are, made the mistakes and are eager to help you avoid those same mistakes.\n\nSize Matters\n\nIn the world of telescopes, the sales people see, to try to baffle us with all the bells and whistles of their hottest selling model. One of the big check points that is often pushed is the amplification level of the telescope lens. While that is a factor that is worth noting, when it comes to a telescope lens, the old phrase “size matters” is a good guideline.\n\nJust remember that your telescope lens works best when it takes in the most light it can from the object you are viewing. So the wider the diameter of the lens, the better a view you are going to get. So don’t fall for the amplification level only. Carefully evaluate the lens size so you have the right fit for what you want to do.\n\nIt Has to Stand on Its Own Feet.\n\nIf you are going to set up a permanent telescope station, then you can bolt the unit down so it is well supported. But many of us have to take our telescopes out into the country for optimum use. So the stand has to be strong and flexible so we can set up the telescope on uneven turf but still feel secure that this important and expensive piece of equipment is going to stand on its own without fear of it falling during our observation time. \n\nWe already mentioned strong and flexible as evaluation guides for the telescope stand but add in ease of use as well. You have to be able to set your telescope up and break it down quickly and easily when you are on a remote viewing. You may even find yourself setting up or taking down your telescope in the dark or by lantern or flashlight if you are taking advantage of the great star displays in the late night sky that make this hobby so exciting. \n\nThese are the basics of what to look for in your new telescope. Finally, make sure the telescope can be enhanced and expanded without having to throw the first unit away and buy something completely new. You want your telescope to grow as your knowledge and skills grow. If your first telescope meets all of these requirements, you are off on the right foot on a long and enjoyable career as an amateur astronomer."},{title:"Asteroids",body:"There is a lot of exciting stuff going on in the stars above us that make astronomy so much fun. The truth is the universe is a constantly changing, moving, some would say “living” thing because you just never know what you are going to see on any given night of stargazing.\n\nBut of the many celestial phenomenons, there is probably none as exciting as that time you see your first asteroid on the move in the heavens. To call asteroids the “rock stars” of astronomy is simultaneously a bad joke but an accurate depiction of how astronomy fans view them. Unlike suns, planets and moons, asteroids are on the move, ever changing and, if they appear in the night sky, exciting and dynamic.\n\nLike rock stars, asteroids have been given their fair share of urban myth and lore. Many have attributed the extinction of the dinosaurs to the impact of a huge asteroid on the earth. This theory has some credibility and, if it is true, it evokes some pretty startling images and foreboding fears in the current reining species on earth, the human race.\n\nThe fact that asteroids are fast moving space debris only makes their movement and activity more interesting and exciting. Unlike a moon, planet or star, the odds that an asteroid could hit the earth are entirely reasonable and in fact, there are many documented cases of small asteroids making it through our atmosphere and leaving some pretty impressive craters in the earth’s surface.\n\nPopular culture has happily embraced the idea of an asteroid impact. The idea has spawned many a science fiction story adding the idea that alien life forms may ride asteroids to our world and start a “war of the worlds” situation. But by far, the most talked about concept that has captured the imagination and the fears of science fiction fans and the general public is of another asteroid hitting the earth that could wipe out life as allegedly happened to the dinosaurs. In fact, the movie “Armageddon” was based on this idea and the concept that somehow mankind could avert that catastrophe with technology.\n\nBut probably the best way to calm our fears and replace science fiction with science is with understanding and knowledge. The truth is, there has been a lot of study of asteroid activity and the serious scientific community has gained significant knowledge of these amazing celestial bodies. A number of probes to asteroids have been conducted which have given us a wealth of information about their composition and how we might predict their behavior. \n\nWe now know that the majority of asteroids we get to witness come from an asteroid belt that exists between Mars and Jupiter. It is from this community of asteroids that many of the notable asteroids emerged. Scientists have gained significant knowledge about the composition of asteroids and separated them into classes including class S which comes of the part of the belt that is closest to Mars, classes C, D and V which are classified by composition and a class called “Centaurs” whose flight patterns take them closer to Jupiter and Uranus.\n\nSome of the probes NASA has conducted on near flying asteroids have performed some pretty amazing studies of these eccentric celestial bodies. In 1994 the Galileo probe got within 1000 miles of the asteroid Ida and discovered that Ida actually had its own moon. \n\nOther probes have fired impactors into asteroids and even landed on an asteroid to produce some amazing scientific data for us. There is much to learn about asteroids in our love of astronomy and that knowledge only makes our enjoyment of seeing them in the cosmos even more exciting."},{title:"The Amazing Hubble",body:"In the history of modern astronomy, there is probably no one greater leap forward than the building and launch of the space telescope known as the Hubble. While NASA has had many ups and downs, the launch and continued operation of the Hubble space telescope probably ranks next to the moon landings and the development of the Space Shuttle as one of the greatest space exploration accomplishments of the last hundred years.\n\nAn amazing piece of astronomy trivia that few people know is that in truth, only about ten percent of the universe is visible using conventional methods of observation. For that reason, the Hubble really was a huge leap forward. That is for the very simple reason that the Hubble can operate outside of the atmosphere of Earth. Trying to make significant space exploration via telescopes from the terrestrial surface of planet Earth is very difficult. That very thing that keeps us alive, our own Earth’s atmosphere presents a serious distraction from being able to see deeper and further into space.\n\nThe Hubble space telescope was named after the great scientist and visionary Edward Hubble who discovered that the universe was expanding which was explained by what is now known in science as Hubble’s Law. To truly get a feel for the amazing accomplishment that was achieved with the launch of the Hubble telescope, spend some time on Nasa’s web site dedicated to the project at http://hubble.nasa.gov. There are also a number of sites where you can enjoy some stunning pictures from the Hubble including http://heritage.stsci.edu/ and http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/hdf.html. It’s hard to believe how long the Hubble has been orbiting earth and sending back amazing video and pictures of what it is discovering in space. But the Hubble was actually initially launched on April 25th 1990. It was the culmination of literally decades of research and construction which began in 1977. Expectations were high as the orbiting telescope was put in place and actually began to function as it was designed to do.\n\nAll was not always perfect with the telescope and the early pictures were disappointing. After some study NASA discovered that the reason for the early failures was the curvatures of one of the main lenses of the orbiting telescope.\n\nWe probably could never have kept this intricate piece of equipment operational as well as we have had we not had the Space Shuttle program to give us a tool to implement repairs and improvements to the Hubble. In 1993 a new lens was installed on the Hubble which corrected the problem of picture resolution that was noted in the early operation of the telescope.\n\nTwo other repair and upgrade mission have been made to the Hubble since it launched, both of them in 1997 to upgrade older equipment and to retrofit the telescope to extend its useful life through 2010. It’s pretty amazing to think that this scientific and mechanical marvel has been operating now for ten years without maintenance. We can be assured that plans are in the works for NASA to upgrade or replace parts on the Hubble to extend its useful life even further as that 2010 time frame draws closer. \n\nIt is hard to imagine the science of astronomy or the natural quest for greater knowledge of our universe without the Hubble. While many times those who would not fund space exploration have tried to cut funding for the Hubble, the operation of this telescope is just too important to astronomers and to the scientific well being of mankind and our planet not to continue to use the Hubble, or its next natural successor. We will always need to have a set of eyes in the sky to watch the universe and discover more of its mysteries."
},{title:"Telescopes 101",body:"Buying the right telescope to take your love of astronomy to the next level is a big next step in the development of your passion for the stars. In many ways, it is a big step from someone who is just fooling around with astronomy to a serious student of the science. But you and I both know that there is still another big step after buying a telescope before you really know how to use it.\n\nSo it is critically important that you get just the right telescope for where you are and what your star gazing preferences are. To start with, let’s discuss the three major kinds of telescopes and then lay down some “Telescope 101″ concepts to increase your chances that you will buy the right thing.\n\nThe three primary types of telescopes that the amateur astronomer might buy are the Refractor, the Reflector and the Schmidt Cassegrain telescope. The first two are named for the kind of lens that is used. It is pretty easy to see that the lens is the heart of the telescope so the kind that you will use will determine the success of your use of that telescope.\n\nThe refractor lens is the simplest because it uses a convex lens to focus the light on the eyepiece. So the lens bends outwards for this purpose. The refractor telescope’s strength is in viewing planets. The reflector’s strength is in seeing more distant objects and the lens is concave or bends in. It uses mirrors to focus the image that you eventually see. The final type, the Schmidt Cassegrain telescope is the most complex and accomplishes the goals of both but it uses an involved system of mirrors to capture the image you want to see.\n\nSo to select just the right kind of telescope, your objectives in using the telescope are important. To really understand the strengths and weaknesses not only of the lenses and telescope design but also in how the telescope performs in various star gazing situations, it is best to do some homework up front and get exposure to the different kinds. So before you make your first purchase…\n\n*	Above all, establish a relationship with a reputable telescope shop that employs people who know their stuff. If you buy your telescope at a Wal-Mart or department store, the odds you will get the right thing are remote.\n\n*	Pick the brains of the experts. If you are not already active in an astronomy society or club, the sales people at the telescope store will be able to guide you to the active societies in your area. Once you have connections with people who have bought telescopes, you can get advice about what works and what to avoid that is more valid than anything you will get from a web article or a salesperson at Wal-Mart.\n\n*	Try before you buy. This is another advantage of going on some field trips with the astronomy club. You can set aside some quality hours with people who know telescopes and have their rigs set up to examine their equipment, learn the key technical aspects, and try them out before you sink money in your own set up.\n\nThere are other considerations to factor into your final purchase decision. How mobile must your telescope be? The tripod or other accessory decisions will change significantly with a telescope that will live on your deck versus one that you plan to take to many remote locations. Along those lines, how difficult is the set up and break down? How complex is the telescope and will you have trouble with maintenance? Network to get the answers to these and other questions. If you do your homework like this, you will find just the right telescope for this next big step in the evolution of your passion for astronomy."}]},function(e,t){e.exports=[{title:"Swallow To Glow A Holistic Approach To Skin Health",body:"The skin is the largest organ in the body. It defends against disease and infection, regulates temperature and even aids in vitamin production. Keeping skin healthy is crucial for beauty and general health, even if most of us are interested in knowing how to keep skin looking healthy, rather than really keeping it healthy.\n\nThe best way to keep skin looking healthy – young, fair, radiant, supple, soft and wrinkle free – is to keep out of the sun.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) rays from the sun bring about a healthy-looking tan, but do much damage to the skin in terms of pigmentation, sunburn and loss of elasticity. These can lead to premature aging in the form of wrinkles, fine lines, sagging, dark skin, uneven skin tone, loss of translucency, enlarged pores and dryness. Even the best of genetics, topical skin lightening treatments and oral skin supplements would be of little use if one tans mercilessly and regularly. Keeping out of the sun helps, but if you cannot avoid it, you will have to ensure that you use a sunscreen. This is especially crucial if sun exposure is for an extended period of time.\n\nAssuming that one is already sensible about sun exposure, how can we then further improve our skin condition? We know that certain oral supplements are effective for good skin health, but which are these supplements and how effective are they?\n\nSupplement From Within\n\nThe first group would be vitamins and minerals, essential for proper functioning of every organ.\n\nThe vitamins and minerals that can affect skin health include the B-complex, especially B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin) and B12 (cyancobalamine). Overt deficiencies of vitamins B1 and B2 are known to cause special forms of dermatitis (a kind of skin inflammation). B12 deficiency is particularly detrimental to neurons and rapidly dividing cells, including skin cells.\n\nBesides the B vitamins, deficiency of vitamin C, iron and copper also affect skin health. All three are important for the synthesis of collagen, a key structural protein in the skin, which fills the skin and gives it tone.\n\nVitamin A is critical for the normal life cycle of skin cells. Vitamin A deficiency causes skin to become dry, fragile and prone to wrinkles. On the other hand, excessive Vitamin A intake may cause serious toxicity and should be avoided.\n\nVitamins C and E, and beta-carotene have been touted as anti-oxidants that reduce free radicals. (Free radicals result in skin degeneration and aging.) However, while free radicals and the role of anti-oxidants are beyond doubt, clinical results have not conclusively proved if supplementary vitamins and other micronutrients improve the skin quality and defy the aging process.\n\nExcessive doses can be just as harmful as deficiencies, so it is best to abide by the recommended daily allowance (RDA).\n\nTopical Help\n\nOral supplements should go hand-in-hand with topical applications – sunscreen of at least SPF 30, creams (preferably with skin whitening agents) and moisturizer (preferably with skin lightening agents). Compared with topical applications, the effects of oral supplements are slower and more subtle. Consumers have to be realistic about their expectations because results certainly will not be seen in 7 days or 2 weeks.\n\nWe recommend a holistic approach to skin health, comprising:\n\n* A healthy balanced diet comprising all food groups as well as vitamins, minerals and micronutrients.\n\n* Keep a happy positive mood. It is well documented that some skin conditions – such as acne and eczema – are more prevalent among the stressed.\n\n* If you smoke, quit smoking. Smoke causes free radicals, damages the microcirculation of skin and also causes staining of teeth and other discoloration.\n\n* Minimize sun exposure and use a good sunscreen on a daily basis."},{title:"Cosmetic Surgery In A Nutshell",body:"Cosmetic surgery, like other forms of elective surgery, involves a physical change to one’s appearance. Also known as plastic surgery, there are two kinds: cosmetic and reconstruction. The latter involves returning an individual’s sense of self after some form of injury and/or illness. The former allows the ability to overcome the physical characteristics one was born with. In a way, the former represents the forefront of how changes in technology can allow changes to the human body.\n\nThis surgery comes in all types, from the use of prosthetics as in breast augmentation and liposuction to non-invasive forms of surgery like laser hair removal or even laser correction of the eyes to eliminate the need for eye glasses.\n\nNone of this comes without a price however. Besides financial concerns, it remains the responsibility of the individual who will undergo such surgery. For this reason, they do need the support of those around them. This is the kind of support that not only affects their decision, but their ability to assimilate the surgical changes to the body.\n\nIn the case of surgery for cosmetic – as oppposed to reconstruction – purposes is the issue of aesthetics. Those around them need to understand the significance societies place upon appearance. How the appearance of someone can alter how they are perceived not only as a person, but as a human being. Surgery for aesthetic reasons, provides people with the opportunity to overcome stigmas associated with their appearance. However, what remains most important is that it’s a choice.\n\nMany – perfectly valid – arguments have been presented to the contrary regarding surgery for cosmetic purposes. However, the fact remains that human beings have been altering their appearance for quite some time now.\n\nCosmetic surgery is significant, not only for what it can achieve, but because it’s a choice made by the person undergoing it. It’s a personal decision about one’s own body.\n\nAnother consideration for the individual, outside of their support system, is that they should do as much of their own personal research as possible into the different kinds of surgery available for each procedure. For example, the current surgical techniques employed and the potential legal restrictions, as is often the case with silicone prosthetics. In addition, weighing the pros and cons of each technique. Finally, the surgeon themselves. An initial consultation is always recommended, as with any form of elective surgery."},{title:"Seven Steps For Keeping Teeth Healthy For A Lifetime",body:"A smile can last a lifetime-if you take care of it.

When the yeast overgrows, it leads to an inflammatory response that kills off scalp cells at a high rate, which in turn slough off in sticky patches and flakes. \n\nThe condition is identified by:\n\n– White or clear flakes on the scalp, through the hair, and on clothing.\n\n– Itchy scalp which may be red and inflamed.\n\nSome young teens find they develop dandruff when they hit puberty because their hygiene habits haven’t changed to meet the challenges of newly accelerated sebum production.\n\nStress, poor hygiene and poor diet can make the scalp more susceptible to dandruff. High sugar foods in particular are known to exacerbate yeast infections.\n\nThe hair should be brushed regularly to loosen flakes and stimulate blood supply to the scalp, which will accelerate the natural immune response to infection.\n\nTREATING DANDRUFF\n\nThere are few habits you can develop and natural treatments you can use to treat dandruff.  \n\nNutrition: An excess of sugar in the diet can exacerbate any yeast infection. Try reducing your intake of all sugars and refined starches while treating for dandruff. \n\nCleansing: Massage your scalp thoroughly with your fingertips when shampooing. This will help loosen and remove any dead skin flakes and help prevent the infection from continuing. Wash your hair daily until the infection is cleared up.\n\nConditioning: Use a protective hair condition on the ends of hair only. Avoid getting conditioner on your scalp where it can clog pores and interfere with healing of the skin.\n\nOther Treatments:\n\n– Massage: Massaging your scalp several times a day with the pads of the fingers only will stimulate blood supply to the hair follicles and help loosen the dead skin flakes.\n\n– Brushing: Brushing your hair thoroughly on a daily basis will help loosen and remove dead skin flakes, increase the smooth flow of sebum along the hair shaft, and increase blood supply to the hair follicles. \n\n– Wash Hands After Brushing and Grooming Hair: Fungal infections of the skin are highly contagious, and it is easy to reinfect and spread to other areas of the body. This is why it’s important to wash your hair daily and to brush out any loose dandruff flakes – so that healthy areas of the scalp will not be infected. Washing your hands after brushing, massaging and grooming your hair will also help prevent reinfection or cross infection.\n\nThe following herbs and nutrients have been shown to reduce dandruff infections:\n\nNatural Internal Treatments for Dandruff\n\nAlpha-Lipoic Acid, Vanadyl Sulfate, Gynema Sylvestre and Chromium are all natural regulators of blood sugar levels. The can help prevent feeding the infection by keeping blood sugar levels normalized.\n\nOlive Leaf and Oregano Leaf are both natural systemic antifungal agents.\n\nNatural External Treatments for Dandruff\n\nThe following herbs can be used as a tonic for reducing fungal infections on a topical basis. Extracts of these herbs or a several drops of their essential oils dissolved in aloe vera gel or witch hazel can greatly relieve the symptoms of itching and flaking in dandruff.

The procedure also enhances breast contour and volume after pregnancy. Breast implant is composed of silicon gel or saline within a silicon shell. Breast implant is different from silicon oil. Most Cosmetic Plastic Surgeon all over the world doesn’t do silicon oil injection of breast to enhance breast size and volume. This technique is condemned both locally and internationally by most surgeon, since the result are unpredictable and compounded by numerous complications such as extrusion, skin necrosis and infection. Patients should not allow them self to be subjected to this procedure, because the risk for unwanted complication is very high and result are deforming or unpredictable. Most surgeon uses Breast Implant which is composed of material that is non toxic, non allergenic, non teratogenic and biocompatible to human tissues and thus have less risk for any unwanted results and with more predictable outcome.\n\nThis is one of the most common cosmetic procedures done world wide specially in the United State. It is a straight forward procedure with a very instantaneous and pleasing result. Because of this, the public’s attention and interest focused on the search of a very safe breast implant material. Breast Augmentation is the only procedure in Cosmetic Plastic Surgery specialty that is the surrounded by controversy and scrutiny. In the past, specially during the late 70’s and early 80’s a lot of medical condition such as breast cancer and autoimmune disease, was wrongfully associated with the use of silicon implant. Because of this the US Food and Drug Administration had regulated the use of silicon breast implant for cosmetic breast procedures until recently in mid 2007. After extensive clinical research study that included more than a thousand breast augmented women, it was found out that silicon breast implant does not cause any malignant disease or breast cancer or any autoimmune disorder. Because of this the US – FDA had approve the use of silicon implant in cosmetic breast procedure.\n\nThere are 2 basic type of breast implants, saline or silicon implants. The implant is compose of an outer membrane compose of silicon shell. This shell contains either saline (fluid) or silicon (cohesive gel) material. It is prudent for every patient to discus extensively the advantage and disadvantage of each implant type with their surgeon before they finalize their decision.\n\nI perform my Breast Augmentation procedure under deep sedation with local anesthesia or general anesthesia. The procedure can be done either as an outpatient surgery or patient can be admitted or confine for a day or two in a hospital, depending on the surgeon and patient’s preference. Weather the procedure will be performed as an Out-Patient or as a Hospital procedure, preoperative laboratory and medical clearance is required. The surgery usually takes one to two hours to complete. The breast implant can be inserted through an incision at armpit or breast folds or at the areolar border. Each choice of incision site has its own advantage and disadvantage in terms of scar cosmesis and nipple sensation. And among the three incisions the transaxillary approach has the best scar cosmesis since it is concealed and nipple sensation is well preserve. But it is advisable to the patient to further discus this issue if ever scaring will be a significant concern. After the procedure there will be some swelling and mild bruising that last for several days to few weeks and this is only a transient changes. Patient is required to wear breast binder for 3 to 6 weeks. This will hold the breast implant in place during the healing process and also help control the swelling. Sutures are removed after 7 to 10 days.\n\nAny patient planning to have this procedure will require 10 to 14 days for the initial consultation, laboratory, medical clearance, surgery; follow up, suture removal and early recuperation.

The full name of laser is Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.\n\nHow laser removes hair- when laser is focused on skin, it get attracted to the pigment of the hair follicle. The laser heats the hair follicles and burns it at the root. The darker the color of the hair, better the results.

The bumps are caused by the underlying fat cells growing too large and stretching the natural fiber compartments that hold the skin to the underlying layers of tissues. “Cellulite” is ordinary fat, but ordinary fat that affects the appearance of the skin. Strands of fibrous collagen tissue connect the skin to the subcutaneous layers and also separate compartments that contain fat cells. When fat cells increase in size, these compartments bulge and produce a rippled appearance of the skin. Women tend to have cellulite more often than men because they have a vertical pattern of collagen in the underlying layer that holds the fat cells, and when the fat cells become very large, they bulge out of the chambers and appear as cellulite.\n\nIn men, the pattern of collagen is tighter, in a diagonal pattern, and they have thicker skin, so there is less bulging of the individual fat cells. Another factor in cellulite is high levels of estrogen, since this hormone has a direct effect on the holding capacity of fat cells through the increase of alpha-adrenoreceptors, the chemical doorways that tell your fat cells to hold on to their contents. Poor diet, bad circulation, and poor lymphatic circulation can all contribute to the appearance of cellulite. \n\nTREATING SKIN WITH CELLULITE\n\nThere are several extra steps you can take for the treatment of cellulite. Consider your skin care regimen, and fine-tune it to meet the needs of skin that has a tendency to swell with fluids, store fat and have poor circulation.\n\nNutrition: Although cellulite is a skin condition, it’s closely tied to the storage of excess fat. If you are significantly overweight, you should certainly alter your diet. The dietary enzyme bromelain can improve overall circulation to your skin and adipose tissues by removing the buildup of fibrin on the walls of blood vessels. Treating cellulite requires a two-pronged approach – one being the shrinking of the fat cells themselves, the second being the regeneration of collagen and strengthening of the skin outside of the swollen fat cells.\n\nCleansing: When cleaning your skin, use your wash cloth or loufah to massage the area where cellulite occurs. At first, use a circular motion and then a brushing motion upwards towards the bowels. This will improve circulation and edema, and help remove toxins and metabolic wastes out of the tissues and interstitial spaces around the collagen and fat cells.\n\nOther Treatments:\n\n– Dry Skin Brushing: Learn to dry brush your skin at least twice every day – upon rising and before going to bed. Skin brushing provides many benefits in the treatment of cellulite. First of all, it’s “exercise” for you skin, and strengthens the underlying dermis and pattern of collagen in the subcutaneous layer. It stimulates the growth and repair of the tissues by increasing blood flow to the area. It also helps remove toxins and metabolic wastes out of the interstitial fluids surrounding the tissues for disposal. Dry brushing is good for you skin all over, but if you are suffering from spider or varicose veins, brushing these areas vigorously several times every day, first in a circular motion and then upwards towards the colon, can improve the appearance of cellulite.\n\n– Hormones: Cellulite is often associated with the use of HRT and birth control pills. High levels of estrogen from these medications can cause an increase in the fatty tissues ability to store fats and cause them to bulge, pushing out the skin and causing cellulite. If you are using birth control pills for contraception, you may want to ask your doctor for a lower-estrogen dose formula or a non-hormonal form, such as an IUD. If you are on HRT, you may want to consider switching to a lower dose, adding progesterone cream, or using a weaker formula, such as an estrone cream. – Habits: Get out of the habit of crossing your legs, knees and ankles. This reduces circulation and increases swelling. Try to keep moving regularly, neither sitting nor standing for long periods. \n\n– Exercise: Regular exercise is necessary for the improvement of cellulite. Not only does it help reduce the appearance of cellulite by burning the fatty acids that are causing the cellulite. It also improves circulation and helps to remove toxin-filled wastes away from the skin. Take up a walking program, or sneaking in a set of exercises in the restroom during breaks. \n\n– Body Wraps: Body wraps, both professional and homemade can improve the appearance of cellulite. Body wraps use a combination of minerals and herbs that stimulate the fat cells to release their contents, they absorb toxins from the skin and reduce swelling. Generally you will find stimulant herbs like kelp or algae that stimulate the fat burning process in the cells. You will find cosmetic clays that will remove toxins and wastes from the pores, and horsetail and horse chestnut that reduce edema (swelling) and provide minerals for strengthening the skin. These formulas are applied to the skin with the use of compression wraps. For recipes for doing home wraps, go to the Botanical Beauty Lab website. \n\n– Massage: Massage, particularly the kind that improves lymph flow, is very good for reducing the appearance of cellulite. It improves the removal of metabolic wastes and toxins from the interstitial tissues around the adipose tissues, and gives the skin a smoother appearance. There are many professionals offering massage for cellulite, including lymphatic massage and endermology, but if that is out of your budget, you may want to try a home massage device. Many are available, from a simple round-prong hand tool to a powered massager that provides heat, massage and suction similar to the professional endermology machines.\n\nSUPPLEMENTS FOR CELLULITE REDUCTION\n\nAlfalfa: Alfalfa is a natural diuretic that helps balance the body’s interstitial fluids and reduces edema and swelling. It’s also a phytoprogesterone, which helps balance the excess estrogen that can exacerbate cellulite.\n\nBorage Oil: Borage oil contains high amounts gamma linoleic acid, which is an important fatty acid to the strengthening of cell walls.\n\nBromelain: Bromelain is a naturally occurring enzyme in natural foods that aid in the digestion of proteins. The consumption of bromelain aids in the removal of fibrin buildup in fine blood vessels. This improves and increases circulation to the skin, and aids in repair and rejuvenation.\n\nHorsetail: Horse Chestnut herb contains high levels of the mineral silica, which is used in the repair and maintenance of skin cells.\n\nCider Vinegar contains an array of important enzymes and aids in balancing body pH. It’s also a good source of potassium, which is necessary for fluid balance in the body.\n\nCoconut Oil contains medium chain triglycerides which are easily absorbed and used by the body for fuel. It has the capability of stimulating the thyroid gland, which increases body temperature and metabolism and is known for improving the burning of excess fat.\n\nGinkgo Biloba is a natural blood thinner that increases the microcirculation to skin and fat cells.\n\nGotu Kolu is a natural source of caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the beta-adrenoreceptors on the surface of the fat cells to release their stores of fatty acids, aiding in the burning of excess fat.\n\nGreen Tea: Green tea is a mild stimulate that contains caffeine as well as powerful antioxidants that aid in the proper replication and repair of skin cells.\n\nMSM: Is an important mineral that is necessary for skin cell repair.\n\nEXTERNAL TREATMENTS FOR CELLULITE\n\nAloe Vera contains alatoin, which sooths and heals skin. It has been shown clinically to increase microcirculation of the skin and to speed healing of skin tissues.\n\nBetonite Clay is a natural mineral clay that is known for its ability to absorb impurities and toxins from the skin through the pores.\n\nHorsetail, ginkgo biloba, kelp and green tea also work externally and can be added to lotions or creams for massage into problem areas.\n\nMany experts have recommended using coffee grounds as a scrub for cellulite prone areas. The grounds work as an exfoliant, as the caffeine absorbs into the skin and stimulate the beta adrenoreceptors in the fat cells to release their contents.\n\nDead Sea Salts and Kelp or bladderwrack contain powerful minerals that aid in the repair of skin cells as well as the mineral iodine which can aid in the metabolism of the underlying fat cells. \n\nThere are also many commercial formulas and methods for the reduction of cellulite. Most contain caffeine or a similar chemical called theophylline or aminophylline. Many also contain kelp, bladderwrack and other herbs mentioned herein.\n\nJust remember that cellulite reduction is a two step process. The cause of cellulite is over-sized fat cells that have stretched out the collagen structure underlying the skin. The first step is to reduce bodyfat, and many herbs and nutrients both external and external can accelerate the process. The second step is to increase the strength of the skin and the collagen webs under the subcutaneous tissues. Skin and collagen require vitamins, minerals and fatty acids to rebuild themselves properly. Excess fluids can exacerbate the problem, so proper fluid intake and circulation is important. Drink plenty of fluids, and stay active to increase the circulation of the lymph system. With a little diligent effort the appearance of cellulite can be reduced."
},{title:"Producing Perfume From Home",body:"Some people find it hard to find the right perfume. This may smell good when this is sprayed into the air but this changes when this reacts with the skin. Those who are tired of this problem can stop looking and instead make one .\n\nThe first step is to get all the materials together. A lot of people focus on the oils and the other liquids and forgetting the basics such as the test tubes, glass beakers and measuring cups.\n\nPeople should avoid using materials made of metal or plastic because these may alter the scent. Glass stir rods should also be used because this will allow the oils to mix better instead of just shaking it.\n\nSince the mixture has to be stored for two days before transferring it into a bottle, the lids should be tight to prevent the liquids from evaporating into the air.\n\nWhen everything is ready, it is time to mix the oils together. Many of these are extracted from plants and some last longer than others thus creating base, middle and top notes.\n\nExamples of base notes are cinnamon, fern, moss and sandalwood. Ylang-ylang, lemongrass and neroli are middle notes while bergamot, lemon, orange and orchid are examples of top notes.\n\nThere are also oils extract from animals but those who detest this can rely on synthetic oils instead.\n\nSince some essential oils do not blend well with others, a bridge note is needed to blend it together. The last thing to add before this is stored for a couple of days is a little ethyl alcohol. This may not always be available so many recommend the use of vodka instead.\n\nAfter two days of storage, the last thing to do will be to mix this with distilled water. This should be filtered so any solid elements are removed and the liquid can be transferred to the plastic bottle.\n\nIt does not take a rocket scientist to come up with a fragrance. This takes practice which is just like excelling in a sport. The only reason why some companies make it so complex is because others mix different notes all together to come up with the desired result.\n\nThose who are just doing this for fun can make homemade perfume using rose petals. But those who plan to turn this into a business should be prepared to turn the kitchen or an empty room in the house into a mini laboratory.\n\nThe person does not have to do everything through trial and error because there are books and other sources to get this information. Some even mention the recipe for a certain concoction which will serve as a guide for anyone who wants to get started.\n\nSome of the concoctions produced will not do that good as hoped. Instead of throwing it out, there are other things that the entrepreneur can do with it.\n\nThe mixture can be used as an air freshener, for aromatherapy, to make scented paper and more. After all, the ingredients that are used to make these other products are the same as perfumes and it can still be put to good use.\n\nMaking a perfume is personal. So, the person has to figure out what scents work for the individual and others out there so there is direction when for making these concoctions."},{title:"Combing Hair 10 Tips For Proper Hair Combing",body:"Most people consider hair combing a routine activity. There are people who keep a particular hair style throughout their life. On the other hand, younger generations adopt new hair styles according to new trends. To have a healthy hair, proper nutrition is required. General health has direct relation with the quality and quantity of hair. In order to make your hair beautiful, you need regular washing, use of hair oil, proper combing, etc.\n\nTips for combing hair:\n\n1. To choose the best comb, you must take into account the nature of your hair (soft or hard, short or long), convenience and style.  \n\n2. Combing hair should be done with greatest care and concentration. If you comb without any care, you can cause damage to your hair.\n\n3. Combing hair should be done gently. A vigorous combing can encourage hair falling.\n\n4. Do not comb wet hair. First dry your hair with a towel and then put some oil and gently massage it. After this is done, the combing will be easy and undamaging.\n\n5. Combing hair in the opposite direction of hairs must be avoided. This will cause hair falling.\n\n6. Vigorous combing in backward direction can cause traction baldness.\n\n7. Frequent combing can damage the hair follicles and the scalp. Combing hair 2 or 3 times in a day is sufficient.\n\n8. The tooth of the comb must not be sharp. The comb should not be pressed too tightly on the scalp.\n\n9. Clean the comb before and after use in order to prevent hair and dirt from depositing in the gap. Combing hair with dirty comb can be difficult and painful.\n\n10. Do not use other people’s combs. This will prevent fungal and bacterial infections."},{title:"Youthful And Vibrant Skin",body:"Billions are spent each year on cosmetic products that promise to delete wrinkles, lighten age spots, and eliminate itching, flaking, or redness. But the simplest and cheapest way to keep your skin healthy and youthful looking is to stay out of the sun.\n\nSunlight is a major cause of wrinkles, dryness, and age spots. Your skin does change with age. For instance, you sweat less which leads to increased dryness. Aging skin becomes thinner and loses fat, so it looks less plump and smooth. Underlying structures, veins and bones in particular, become more prominent. Your skin can also take longer to recover when injured.\n\nThese changes can be drastically delayed by staying out of the sun. Although nothing can totally undo sun damage, the skin sometimes can restore itself. So, it’s never too late to protect yourself from the harmful results of the sun. 5 Ways to Slow the Aging Process:\n\n1. Wear protective clothing. A hat with a wide brim shades your neck, ears, eyes, and head. Look for sunglasses with a label saying the glasses block 99 to 100 percent of the sun’s rays. Wear loose, lightweight, long-sleeved shirts and long pants or long skirts when in the sun.\n\n2. Check your skin often. Look for changes in the size, shape, color, or feel of birthmarks, moles, and spots. If you find any changes that worry you, see a doctor. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests that older, fair-skinned people have a yearly skin check by a doctor as part of a regular physical exam.\n\n3. Avoid artificial tanning. Don’t use sunlamps and tanning beds, as well as tanning pills and tanning makeup. Tanning pills have a color additive that turns your skin orange after you take them. The FDA has approved this color additive for coloring foods but not for tanning the skin. The large amount of color additive in tanning pills may be harmful. Tanning make-up products are not suntan lotions and will not protect your skin from the sun. \n\n4. Use sunscreen. Sunscreens are rated in strength according to a sun protection factor (SPF), which ranges from 2 to 30 or higher. A higher number means longer protection. Buy products with an SPF number of 15 or higher. Also look for products whose label says: broad spectrum (meaning they protect against both types of harmful sun rays(UVA and UVB) and water resistant (meaning they stay on your skin longer, even if you get wet or sweat a lot). Remember to reapply the lotion as needed.\n\n5. Stay out of the sun. Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. This is when the sun?s UV rays are strongest. Don?t be fooled by cloudy skies. Harmful rays pass through clouds. UV radiation also can pass through water, so don’t assume you?re safe if you?re in the water and feeling cool."},{title:"Tips For Choosing The Perfect Gloss For Your Lips",body:"One should remember that perfection is ten percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. So searching for the lip gloss that best suits the lip color and lip tone one has is an endeavor that requires patience, perseverance and a little (just a little) bit of luck. Hopefully, the following tips will better the chances of discovering the lip gloss that best suits the lips you have on you.\n\n1. Be open, do not forget to experiment!\n\nThere are numerous brands of lip gloss and the prices of each vary. A $7 lip gloss bought at a neighborhood drugstore is not necessarily inferior in quality compared to an $18 Poole lip gloss compact. Lips could only appreciate the texture, smoothness, silkiness of the gloss or feel its heaviness, stickiness, or icky-ness. Little do lips care about how much the lip gloss cost or where it was bought. Though high-end lip glosses at times do offer a super-glossy feel that it almost glides delightfully on the lips, there are also not too expensive lip glosses like Bonne Bell which could give the high-end brands a run for their money. A label is not everything. Sometimes, a great find could be found in dollar stores. Try your luck, win or lose, its all worth a dollar. But, if buying in a drugstore or at Wal-mart, make sure that extensive research has been done on the lip gloss product you are considering of buying since drugstores offer no testers. 2. A Gloss Is Not Forever\n\n– Reapply to preserve the dye\n\n– Some brands, even the best ones, fade off after a few hours\n\n– Some people really do not like the feel of a heavy gloss\n\n– Judge by your lip color not anyone else’s\n\n3. Selection Tips\n\nMake sure to choose a lip gloss based on the lip color you have since the color of your lips automatically affects the color of the gloss applied on it. Never choose based on how good or bad a lip gloss looks on Jennifer Anniston or Angelina Jolie. Jennifer has thin pale lips while Angelina has full pucker-up ones. Naturally, yours is similarly worlds apart from theirs, if not better. Lip gloss colors appear differently on different kinds of people. One’s own lip color plays an important part because your natural lip color will shine through. So does your natural lip tone, the pigmentation of the lip gloss, how convenient is it when applied and whatever it is you’re looking for a lip gloss. Clearly this is as unique, individual and personalized as it could be. 4. Not All That Glitters Is Good\n\nNo matter how great it looks, make sure that the lip gloss put on the lips feels comfortable, as if it’s almost like it wasn’t there. Lip gloss glitter that feels gritty or sharp should not be tolerated by the lips or by you. Do not be afraid to return it to the store and politely explain to the store clerk or – preferably – the store manager your problem. It should be exchanged for another less grittier tube. But if the same trouble persists maybe it is time to change to a different brand, specifically one that has not too much glitter that it hurts. \n\nBe realistic, lip gloss gives lips a smooth shimmer, it does not provide anyone with kissable cottony-soft lips. Lip balms do that. Balms are not shiny. But it makes lips feel supple. Apply a balm over the lips first before putting on a lip gloss, this is to moisturize the lips. Gloss is supposed to be – you’ve guessed it – glossy. If it does not, troop to the shop or store where it was bought from, you are supposed to get the product you purchased for."},{title:"Sensible Beauty Tips For Enhancing Your Appearance",body:"There are many simple beauty tips that don’t have to take up a lot of time.

Some nail salons are havens for bacteria and germs, and a small cuticle cut can cause a serious fungal infection if proper hygiene techniques are not followed through. The health risks associated with salons, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, include bacterial infections; fungal infections like athlete’s foot, nail fungus and yeast; and viral infections.\n\nBecoming aware of your salon’s surroundings and sanitary procedures is critical to keep your experience pleasant and healthy. Here are a few tips from BTG Cosmetics Inc. on what to look for during your next salon visit:\n\n* How are nail tools, such as clippers, cuticle scissors and files sanitized? Heat sterilization or chemical sterilization with a germicide and fungicide is preferred. Some salons take extra precautions by using freshly unwrapped nail files for every client. * Are you receiving a thorough scrub? Nails should be soaked and cleaned with soap before the service begins. Also, make sure the soap bin has been cleaned well. * Outer appearances matter. A neat and organized space can reveal a lot about the salon’s practices. Also, find out if your salon is operating under current licenses and that technicians are properly licensed and trained.\n\n* When you pick out the polish color, wouldn’t you prefer it to be unopened? Many salon patrons are concerned about unsanitary tools, but what about the hundreds of people who use the same nail polish? “Sanitizing instruments is only part of the solution,” said Ben Friedman, president of BTG Cosmetics. “Using a clean, fresh bottle of nail polish will ensure your nails are kept sanitary. Nail polish should be treated just like a toothbrush and I certainly wouldn’t want to share my toothbrush with anyone.”\n\nThe company has developed a new program called Toma Salon Service, which is available in various nail salons across the country. Rather than choosing a color that has been opened and used, nail services at these salons now include a new, unopened bottle of Toma SlimLine polish that you get to take home after your service is complete. And should you get a chip in the polish afterwards, you can easily repair it at home with the polish that was included with your service."},{title:"Tips For A Healthy Clear Complexion",body:"For many women, visiting the skin care aisle at the drugstore can be as intimidating as ordering from all the complicated hot beverages on offer at the trendy local coffee shop.

Celebrity makeup artist Tasha Reiko Brown shares knowledge on how to best tackle common skin care concerns, with some helpful tips on choosing the right products: Problem: Do I need to exfoliate? It seems harsh. Solution: One of the best ways to cleanse is by exfoliating. It stimulates the skin as you cleanse, giving your face a nice and radiant glow. Try cream-based cleansers with skin-smoothing microbeads that gently exfoliate to help reveal fresh, polished skin. For best results, make little circles with fingertips in a clockwise motion. Pay extra attention to the thicker, oily areas of your face to achieve an all-over glow. Problem: I don’t have much time to tend for my skin. Solution: For the woman who is looking for an effective and efficient skin care solution, deep cleansing can be as basic and satisfying as pouring a simple cup of joe. Try the Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream. A tried-and-true classic, it dissolves oil while conditioning skin, without overdrying, leaving skin feeling clean, soft and smooth in one easy step. Best of all, you can feel its signature eucalyptus-infused formula working as it deep cleans. And this invigorating beauty staple comes in Original and Plus Moisturizers. Problem: I can never seem to beat blemishes. Solution: The key to not only beating but also preventing blemishes is to use products that deep clean but are also gentle enough to use on a daily basis. Always look for products that contain salicylic acid, which is a proven ingredient to fight acne blemishes and breakouts. Salicylic acid can be found in toners, cleansers and cleansing pads, so you can pick and choose the best combination for your lifestyle. Problem: Traveling interrupts my beauty regimen. Solution: No matter how busy you are, never skimp out on facial cleansing in your daily beauty routine. Dirty skin looks dull and sallow, and it’s more prone to breakouts.

This is done to protect you from buying the wrong type or grade of contact lens.

They leave the skin soft, supple and glowing – in short, beautiful. Regular users of sauna and steam baths have an appealing healthy glow about them that adds to their attractiveness. The reason that sauna and steam are so good for the skin is the deep cleaning action caused by heavy perspiration. The pores open wide and all the accumulated dirt can be easily washed out. The best benefits for skin toning come from full body sauna, but for those looking for a quick fix-up to their complexion can get similar results from facial sauna systems. These ‘mini-saunas’ are designed to apply steam to the face for the same deep cleaning action as a full sauna or steam bath. How They Work A facial sauna has an electric heating element on the bottom of the unit. It heats the water (which is held in a small reservoir) to the boiling point, causing the steam to rise. The small size of the reservoir ensures that steam is quickly produced. An ergonomically designed mask is placed over the reservoir to capture and funnel the steam to your face. You can control the amount of steam that your face is exposed to by the distance of the mask to your face. Bringing your face into direct contact with the mask gives the maximum deep cleaning action, but this position should only be used for a few moments at a time. After about 10 seconds, raise your head to allow cooler air to be mixed with steam. Repeat this cycle as many times as needed. Facial saunas are not only for deep cleansing the skin; they are also useful for unclogging stuffed sinuses. Anyone with a simple cold or a more serious condition like bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma and hay fever can use the facial sauna as an inhaler or vaporizer. Some facial saunas have a separate inhaler attachment. Instead of fitting over the entire face, the inhaler attachment fits over the nose and mouth. Simply breathe in the steam to provide almost instant relief from sinus pain. Operating Tips Most facial saunas have a very small reservoir so that the water can heat up fast. The downside of this is that the water evaporates quickly, so if you wish to use the sauna for an extended session, you should keep a tall glass of water by your side. This way, you can quickly refill the reservoir when it goes dry. The small reservoir, unfortunately, also means that the facial sauna cannot be used as an overnight vaporizer. If your sinuses are keeping you awake at night, you would be better off with a traditional vaporizer that provides steam for several hours. Steam is great for deep cleaning the skin, but for an additional beauty treatment you can add special cleaners such as tea tree oil to the water. Just a few drops of this oil will give your skin an even brighter glow and leave it feeling fresh and supple. Facial saunas are relatively inexpensive — usually less than $60. For this price, almost everybody can enjoy the deep cleaning action and the special ‘glowing’ skin that marks regular sauna users apart from the crowd."},{title:"10 Steps To Look Younger",body:"The secret of the youth has been searched since long time ago.

There are thicker plates to be used with longer-length hair and there are thinner ceramic plates to use with shorter hair. Quite a bit of information regarding this can be found on the Internet.   Imagine straightening your hair without ruining it with harmful chemicals or without it snagging or the ends breaking off. The Sedu hair straightener has four different heat settings which help you straighten your hair within only about 15 to 20 minutes. Furthermore, if you don’t know if you want straight hair for the rest of your life the Sedu straightener can help you see what you would look like with straight hair before making a commitment to having your hair permanently chemically treated in a salon, or even at home.   If you choose to have your hair permanently straightened, you can do that too but keep in mind that you should do a strand test to make sure your hair can handle the straightening chemicals. That would be done by either you or your hair stylist. Then you would have to put on a protective cream in order to shield your hair from the chemicals being used, and afterwards add a relaxant cream. You would not have to redo your hair if you use a chemical treatment, but the steps to having it done (or doing it yourself) are more extensive, and it is riskier than just using a Sedu straightener.   The Sedu Ceramic Hair Straightener can create more temporary styles and you can have a new style every single day if you want. Some days you could add a little curl to it and other days you can have it completely straight and it would not remain permanently. You can also apply a variety of different styles after receiving a chemical hair straightening treatment, but again, it is more risky when you attempt to use harmful chemicals in your hair.   There are easy steps to apply when attempting to apply a Sedu Ceramic hair straightening style. Those steps are as follows:\n\nStart out with clean, wet, hair Apply a small amount of styling product such as mousse or gel to your hair Dry your hair, combing downward for approximately 15 minutes Divide your hair into sections and then begin straightening your hair Style your hair according to your favorite Sadu Styling technique    Many of these looks are modeled after Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Simpson and other great celebrities. Free photos of these celebrities are posted online as well. You can take a look at these photos to use as models for your next Sedu hairstyle."},{title:"Herbal Skin Care Secrets Hidden At The Greengrocer S",body:"Interest in skin care supplements, or beauty foods, has been strong in Asia, and that trend is growing fast in Europe as well. These nutrient rich beauty foods make a good case for starting a beauty regime from within, one that is designed to prevent or reduce the effects of aging, like sagging skin.\n\nSome products on the market include a supplement containing lacto-lycopene, vitamin C, and soy isoflavones. This is aimed at restoring firmness to the skin for women over 40, and was developed by Nestle and L’Oreal. Others have been developed using lycopene and grape seed extract, both antioxidants. Grape seed extract also stops enzymatic reactions that lead to collagen in the skin being broken down. Antioxidants protect the capillaries in skin and thus ensure that enough nutrients get to the living cells that eventually push their way to the surface and become the skin you see in the mirror. They also protect from broken veins and early wrinkling. Capillaries also deliver oxygen to the cells, and remove the waste products of cellular metabolism. This prevents puffy, sagging, and dull skin.\n\nBut you don’t always need to reach for a bottle of supplements. Simply by eating more antioxidant rich food on a daily basis should see some improvement in skin tone. Fruits rich in antioxidants include blueberries, prunes, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, apples, cherries and plums. And of the vegetables, eat more artichokes, broccoli, red cabbage, pontiac potatoes, brown onions, asparagus, non-green capsisum, beetroot, spinach and sweet potatoes.\n\nWomen are more prone to the damage caused by antioxidants than men, according to research from the University of Berkeley, and hence possibly their aging effects (Angyal).\n\nAnother strong antioxidant is beta carotene. Beta carotene is found in green leafy vegetables, fruit and carrots. This antioxidant has been found to counteract the effects of a particular type of oxygen free radical, singlet oxygen, which occurs after the skin is exposed to UV radiation in sunlight. UV exposure can lead to premature aging by the effects of singlet oxygen. A study found that whilst the provitamin A aspect of the carotenoid did not combat the singlet oxygen, the beta carotene did. It prevented the action of two enzymes, associated with UV light and the destruction of the skin cell’s extracellular matrix, which happens in premature aging of the skin. Sunlight also destroys beta carotene in cells after sun exposure, so this beta carotene has to be replaced. Beta carotene has been reported as having a mild sunscreen effect too, though it needs to be taken as a supplement to get this effect.\n\nThe skin care supplement beauty market is still not a strongly developed one however, as these types of supplements tend to be more expensive than other supplements. And there needs to be more research and clinical trials to prove which products do what they are designed to.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. http://www.nutraingredients.com/news/ng.asp?n=54477-beta-carotene-boosts\n\n2.

People have this misconception that acne only happens during teenage years and gradually wears off as they age. For most people, this fact may be true but it is important to note that acne does not start during teenage years only. However, it is important to note that there are a significant number of adults that experience such condition.\n\nThere are lots of reasons why a person develops adult acne. But, it is important to take note that majority of the people that suffers from this condition are those who also experienced acne problems during their teens. It is also important to remember that the treatment for this is not the same when you were in your teens since your skin is already different from how it used to be. Because of this, here are some tips on how to treat adult acne.\n\n1.  First, buy a reputable over the counter acne treatment product. OTC products could easily treat mild acne breakouts. Nowadays, there are lots of acne treatments that are available in the market. But, you need to be aware if the product is safe to use or not. Some products were proven ineffective and might have harsh elements that could further damage your skin. If you were afraid to buy random products, it would be best to consult your dermatologist. This will ensure that the product suits your skin type as well. Or, you may ask for recommendations from friends and family members who encountered a similar case of acne like yours. Or, you may do your own research on the product’s way of how to treat adult acne.\n\n2.  Second, for serious breakout and if OTC products do not seem to work undergo cosmetic procedures in a reputable derma clinic. Cosmetic procedures such as microdermabrasion and laser resurfacing are some of the common procedures how to treat adult acne. Keep in mind that these procedures should be done using clean materials so it would be best to visit a reputable clinic.\n\n3.  Third, never squeeze your acne! A lot of adults have this desire to squeeze or prick their zits on their own which could cause further damage due to scars. Never ever do that because squeezing will only push the infection deep into the skin.\n\n4.  Fourth, eat healthy foods. In order to flush away toxins that could cause acne, you need to drink lots of water and eat fruits and vegetables. Keep in mind that well-hydrated skin has better chances to rejuvenate rather than dry skin. Also, try to live a healthy lifestyle by having a well-rested body. Keep in mind that stress is one of the causes of acne as well so it really pays if you get your eight-hours worth of sleep per day.\n\nThere are other tips that could help how to treat adult acne but these are some of the basic things that you need to follow. Try one tip after the other and surely, you will be able to find something that will work for you."},{title:"Hollywood Hairstyles Do Not Require A Trip To A High Priced Salon Or Beautician",body:"There’s a new hairstyle that seems to be sweeping Hollywood: what would you be willing to do to get it for yourself?

A certain scent on a good friend may smell quite differently on you as each fragrance reacts differently according to our own chemical makeup.\n\nWhen testing a perfume in a store, be sure to wait about 10 minutes to allow the fragrance to react to your body chemistry before buying it. Smell it after the first application and then smell it again after waiting. This allow you to sample both the top and middle notes of the scent and give you a good sense of how the fragrance will linger throughout the day.\n\nBe sure to limit how many fragrances you try at one time at the store – stick to just 3 or 4 at a time. Otherwise your olfactory senses may become overwhelmed and you may not be able to tell one perfume from the other!\n\nIf you are concerned about an allergic reaction, wait about an hour or so after sampling the perfume. If no reaction occurs by that time, it is probably safe to go ahead and splurge on that new perfume!\n\nAlways apply fragrances directly to your skin or hair, as some fragrances (especially parfums and eau de parfums which have a higher concentration of oils) may cause discoloration on certain fabrics. Never spray fragrances directly on silk – it will damage it!\n\nIf you like to spritz a bit on your clothing, be sure to test it first on hidden area such as an inner lining before spraying it all over yourself! This is especially true for delicate fabrics and “dry clean only” clothing.\n\nI suggest changing your fragrance depending upon the season. In other words, go for lighter scents during the hotter weather and keep the stronger scents for the drier, cool weather. Heat intensifies the scent, so there is no need to douse yourself in a heavy scent during the summer. And if you are outdoors, be aware that bees, wasps, hornets, and other flying bugs are attracted to flowery fragrances (which is another good reason to stick to light, clean scents!)\n\nSpeaking of heat, if you want to keep that favorite perfume as fresh as the day you bought it, keep the bottle in a cool, dark place. Keep the bottle in it’s original box, if possible. You may even want to keep it in the fridge, so you can have a refreshingly cool spritz of your perfume before heading out for the day!"

Even when people say beauty is skin deep and it’s what’s inside that matters it is always easier to make people listen to what you have to say when you come in a good “package”. \n\nBeauty entails a lot of hard work, and it also involves tremendous expenses. But there are always opportunities for you to get great deals on beauty products if you know where and when to buy.\n\nIf you are a beauty junky, it is always wise to try to find products you can save on so you can stay on budget and even buy more products for your budget. You would also want to get the best rates for the products you try because not all these products will match your needs and you don’t want to be wasting too much money on products that you wouldn’t use anymore.\n\nOne of the best ways to get huge discounts on beauty products is to use product coupons and discount coupons to get additional savings on a particular product.  There are websites particularly designed to provide consumers promos and discount rates and all you have to do is take advantage of the discounts that retailers and distributors offer.\n\nYou can also save a lot of money by purchasing your beauty products online. Internet retailers and distributors can afford to give bigger discounts and promotional offers because they have lower operating expenses than retailers that have physical stores. \n\nAnother way to save money is to buy certain items in bulk. You want to do this for beauty products that you have already tried and tested and already use regularly. Items like soaps and shampoos you can buy in bulk but face creams, foundation, liquid mascara and other beauty products, it is best to buy a new one when the old one is about to run out. Creams, lipsticks and other beauty products don’t have expiration dates on them but they do expire. When the scent of a beauty product starts to change, it is time to toss it out. \n\nIf possible, try to get free samples of new beauty products and treatments that you want to try. The free samples will allow you to try beauty products without spending a cent. Not all beauty products will “agree” with your skin and you don’t want to spend a lot of money on one whole tube of cream that you will only get to use once. Retailers usually provide sachets or small portions of the beauty products when they are first launched in the market. Some brands allow free trial of their products in the mall. You must take advantage of all these opportunities so that you can save money but also discover new products."},{title:"Aiming For Higher The Mastopexy",body:"Breast lift surgery, clinically referred to as a mastopexy, restores a youthful appearance to a woman’s breasts.

Cosmetic dentists often do, as they strive to create the perfectly proportioned smile.\n\n“I believe there is an ideal proportion to teeth in the most naturally beautiful smile,” says David Nusblatt, a dentist in Manhattan who often uses Lumineers to perfect his patients’ smiles.\n\nDentists such as Nusblatt are increasingly adopting Lumineers as the procedure of choice over traditional veneers. Lumineers, made from patented Cerinate porcelain, are painless and minimally invasive. The procedure, which requires only two visits to the dentist, requires no anesthetic or numbing shots.\n\nUnlike Lumineers, traditional veneers involve drilling or grinding of the teeth – often down to the nubs. Patients require an anesthetic for the process and painkillers for recovery. Because the sensitive tooth structure is destroyed, the process is irreversible. “Lumineers allows me to create a smile that is balanced and perfect for every unique face in the most minimally invasive way,” Nusblatt said.\n\nContact lens-thin, yet strong, Lumineers are proven to last up to 20 years. In most cases, the original teeth are left intact, making the procedure completely reversible.\n\n“I have gone through life very self-conscious about my teeth and my smile,” said Ben Ferrari of Nipomo, Calif. “From an early age I had an extremely large gap. With Lumineers I had an instant, beautiful smile. I was very amazed with the results, and to top it off, the procedure took only 40 minutes.”\n\nLumineers, named one of Dental Products Report’s list of “Top 10 Products,” can be used over crowns and on worn teeth to prevent further wear. In some cases, they also can be a convenient substitute for braces."},{title:"What Is Botox",body:"What is Botox?\n\nBotox is a trade name for botulinum toxin A. In this way, Botox is related to botulism. Botulism is a form of food poisoning. Botulinum toxin A is one of the neurotoxins (a neurotoxin is a toxin that acts specifically on nervous tissue) produced by Clostridium botulinum.\n\nThe most serious symptom of botulism is paralysis, which in some cases has proven to be fatal. The botulinum toxins (there are seven — types are A through G) attach themselves to nerve endings. Once this happens, acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter responsible for triggering muscle contractions, cannot be released. A series of proteins are essential for the release of acetylcholine. Certain botulinum toxins attack these proteins. Basically, the botulinum toxins block the signals that would normally tell your muscles to contract. Say, for example, it attacks the muscles in your chest — this could have a profound impact on your breathing. When people die from botulism, this is often the cause — the respiratory muscles are paralyzed so it’s impossible to breathe.\n\nWhy Botox?\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering why anyone would want to have a botulinum toxin injected into his or her body. The answer is simple: If an area of the body can’t move, it can’t wrinkle.\n\nBotox injections are the fastest-growing cosmetic procedure in the industry, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS). In 2001, more than 1.6 million people received injections, an increase of 46 percent over the previous year. More popular than breast enhancement surgery and a potential blockbuster, Botox is regarded by some as the ultimate fountain of youth.\n\nA little history\n\nBotox was first approved in 1989 to treat two eye muscle disorders–uncontrollable blinking (blepharospasm) and misaligned eyes (strabismus). In 2000, the toxin was approved to treat a neurological movement disorder that causes severe neck and shoulder contractions, known as cervical dystonia. As an unusual side effect of the eye disorder treatment, doctors observed that Botox softened the vertical frown (glabellar) lines between the eyebrows that tend to make people look tired, angry or displeased. But until this improvement was actually demonstrated in clinical studies, Allergan Inc., of Irvine, Calif., was prohibited from making this claim for the product.\n\nBy April 2002, the FDA was satisfied by its review of studies indicating that Botox reduced the severity of frown lines for up to 120 days. The agency then granted approval to use the drug for this condition.\n\nHow is Botox applied?\n\nBotox is injected with a very tiny needle. After Botox injection, the muscles will relax and the skin will smooth out over about 5 days. The effect usually lasts about six months, and can be repeated when needed.\n\nThere are very few side effects to this procedure. While allergy to any medicine is possible, it is rare with Botox. While a small amount of brow or lid droop is possible, it is unusual and can usually be avoided by not treating the area just above the outer portion of the brow. If it does happen, it goes away by itself.\n\nOriginally used for treating nervous twitch of the eyelid muscles, it was discovered that the crow’s feet, frown lines and forehead creases can be flattened dramatically. Neck Bands can sometimes be helped also.\n\nWho Can Provide Botox Cosmetic Treatments?\n\nAny authorized healthcare professional can administer BOTOX      "},{title:"Pueraria Mirifica And Study Phyto Estrogens",body:"Before we begin to give you additional information on this topic, take a moment to think about how much you already know.\n\nEnlargement of the underground corm accumulates phyto-estrogens (Hormone from Plant) comprising isoflavones (daidzin, daidzein, genistin, genistein and puerarin) and others such as miroestrol and its derivatives, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, coumestrol, puerarin, mirificoumestan, kwakhurin and mirificin.\n\nThe scope of our study is the biotechnology of the White, Red and Black Kwao Krua.

There are so many things that demand your time and attention. Between work, kids, family and household chores, there is precious little time left over for you. So, it is completely understandable why things like salon reservations get pushed to the end of your priority list. But is it at the end of the “to do” list where your next hair trim belongs?\n\nThe answer to that question is, of course, no. There are many reasons why you should keep your salon reservation. Aside from taking a little bit of time and relaxation for yourself, which I know is not going to motivate you since all of your energy goes toward enriching the lives of others and not your own, there are many practical reasons why you should not call and cancel your next reservation. Here are 5 Reasons:\n\n1. Keeping up with hair maintenance saves you time. You know how it is, your hair is doing just fine until that fateful morning on which you realize that your hair is way past due for a trim. It just won’t do anything. So, after hours of trying to coerce your hair into the style that it held beautifully just yesterday you resign yourself to the fact that nothing except a haircut will fix your bad hair day. But we all know that a spur-of-the-moment haircut is hard to come by. That means that you will spend the next week or so wasting time trying to style your overgrown locks while waiting for your reservation. Only if you would have kept your original reservation. You see, getting a regular trim, even if you think you can squeeze by another week or two, prevents this mess from happening in the first place. A cut that is the perfect length and shape will be a breeze to style in the mornings, and that will save you time.\n\n2. Keeping your reservation saves you money. If your stylist has regular opportunities to keep your hair in tip top shape, he or she will have to do less in the long run to keep you looking beautiful. If you continually let your style grow out or let your color fade, your stylist will have to do more work to bring your wayward tresses back in line again. More work equals more time, and we all know that time equals money.\n\n3. There is never a better time than today to get your hair done. Sure, we all think that we’ll have more time next week, that our work load will be less than it is today. But does that ever really happen? Let’s face it; next week will be just as busy as this week. And when you’re busy, a little bit of R & R will give you the energy that you need to keep going.\n\n4. Another reservation is weeks away. Why do you go to your stylist? It’s because he or she is a fantastic stylist and knows your hair inside and out. Well, if your stylist is this great with you, I’m sure there are other clients dying for your stylist’s services. If you miss this reservation, it could be weeks before you get another one.\n\n5. Keep your reservation out of respect. When you make a reservation, your stylist carves out time from a hectic day to cater to you. If you don’t show or cancel at the last minute, your stylist will end up sitting around making no money when he or she could have filled that time slot with another guest. Canceling reservations repeatedly may cause you to be placed on a pay in advance or last minute reservation list. Or even in some cases you can get fired for missing too many reservations. Granted, sometimes things happen that make canceling an appointment a necessity. When this is the case, be sure to give a minimum 24 business hours and reschedule as soon as you can. Not only will your stylist thank you, but your hair will as well."},{title:"Hoop Earrings A Style From History",body:"Earrings add beauty to a face. Different types of earrings suit different faces.

Many believe that women are the main gender that go for cosmetic surgery. Yet studies have shown that 11% of men are also getting cosmetic surgery – in fact since 1992, the percentage of men getting cosmetic surgery has gone up by 50%. Middle aged men see plastic surgery as an investment in their career prospects. It is important to know that it is neither sex nor age which makes some type of aesthetic surgery procedure feasible, but what is important is a good general health condition. The stress of being beautiful is taking a strain on many people. People are spending about 10% of their gross income on cosmetic surgeries. Regarding age, there are some procedures such as facelift which are more frequently done on people over 40; however there are people over 55 who still may not need it. On the other hand, there are also patients under 40 who may benefit from this surgery.   Talk to a cosmetic surgeon to see whether you really need extensive changes in your appearance. Learn if a face lift is right for you. Talk it over with partners, friends, spiritual counsellors or life coaches if need be.\n\nCosmetic surgery covers a wide range of procedures, including obesity and weight loss surgery, breast augmentation, liposuction & face surgery. A facelift can be done alone, or in conjunction with other procedures such as a forehead lift or an eyelid surgery. Alternatives to surgery exist. Laser cosmetic surgery may be performed around the eyes or the mouth. More consumers are considering injectables to prolong or avoid facelifts, forehead lifts and eyelid surgeries. Eyelid surgery Sagging upper eyelids or bags under the eyes can be one of the clearest signs of facial ageing. Patients interested in eyelid or eye brow surgery may have noticed drooping or sagging of the skin around the eyes. Eyelid surgery, technically called blepharoplasty, corrects not only the eyelids but also eyebags. Often, the procedure is done with another cosmetic operation, such as a facelift. To remove your eyebags whilst lifting your face is only a matter of more time for the surgeon. The goal of eyelid surgery is to remove excess skin gravity and sun exposure damage. Patients usually request for surgery to remove eyebags and to firm the lower eyelid area. In lower eyelid surgery, the surgeon makes the incision in an inconspicuous site along the lashline and smile creases of the lower lid. This is a very effective way of performing the surgery without leaving any obvious scarring. \n\nFacial surgery\n\nThe face as a whole must be considered if the optimum outcome of cosmetic surgery is to be achieved. A facelift can help rejuvenate the lower face, giving it a fresher, healthier appearance.  The face lift works well for the jaw line and the neck. By improving facial muscle tone, you can literally lift years off your face. Muscles, fat and deep tissues of the face are all lifted and repositioned so skin is draped over more youthful contours. Most surgeons agree that the best time for the first facial cosmetic surgery is whenever it is needed. Microdermabrassion and non surgical face lifts are alternatives to surgery, in conjunction with a natural facial with elements such as green tea that promote skin wellness. It is also recommended to use facial and body massage therapy after treatments to relax you and speed your recovery. Face aerobics are terrific and can save money in cosmetic surgery. \n\nPersonal testimony of facial surgery\n\nThe following is a true personal testimony written by a good friend of mine, Bethany Lee, specifically for this article and with her full permission. She is keen to share her experiences with others who may read it. I had cosmetic surgery some years ago – my first operation was for my eyes. I had very many creases around them and was unhappy with my appearance. I contacted an agent for cosmetic surgery, thinking about whole face surgery. After a discussion with her, she convinced me to start by having correction around my eyes. The operation I had was performed under local anaesthetic although this method isn’t entirely suitable for many people as it is quite painful. It is possible to have it done under general anaesthesia, or ‘twilight anaesthesia’. Some tie it in with other surgery such as a facelift procedure. Still, I opted for the local anaesthetic – I found it comforting to be able to talk to the surgeon and his nurse and know what was going on, but it is not for the faint hearted. The operation itself took about one and a half hours and I was able to have a cup of tea, don dark glasses and go home. I was given pain killers, antibiotics and eye ointment .\n\nThe painkillers were hardly needed. Although very bruised and swollen when I arrived home, my husband could see a remarkable difference in that the operation had completely removed my eye bags and wrinkles around the eyes. After the bruising and swelling finally went down (less than a week) the difference was amazing. I could see better and I looked so much younger. I was absolutely delighted. It set me off. I was worried about my developing jowels. There was no doubt about it – the cosmetic surgery loomed. I contacted the same agent I had seen before, and she showed me how my face would look after surgery. This time I opted for a full face lift. The operation took 4 hours and this was done under general anaesthetic. I must admit I suffered a lot of bruising – more than most and it took about a week to settle down but after fortnight I was transformed. I found chewing sugar free dental gum useful, it helped me exercise my jaw and kept things moving. I looked better, felt better and started to look after myself more. It gave me the incentive to start exercising again. People were complimenting me on how well I looked. The incision lines were in well hidden places in my hair line and behind my ears, so there was no way anyone could actually tell that I had undergone surgery.\n\nI was told the eye surgery would last 7 years but it is 15 years now and they still look good. Just a very slight wrinkling on the left side, which is easily correct with makeup. I have regularly used creams to keep my skin in the best possible condition. I know that people say that a cheap cream is as good as an expensive one but I refute that totally. I have bought most of the creams on the market and find that Syence is by far the most effective. This is one of the few creams that has scientifically documented proof that it thickens the skin – useful in the more mature lady! I find it invaluable, as it has kept my face very soft and near on wrinkle free.\n\nFinally, I would say find a good cosmetic surgeon. Ask around, do not go for the cheapest or the most expensive – go for reputation. See photographs of his work if possible and ask questions. It’s your money and your face – you have the right to demand the best. Naturally things can go wrong but rarely do and they can be put right. I find yoga is a great help as it keeps mind and body in tune. A good balanced diet of fresh organic fruit, vegetables and olive oil add to a healthy skin, which will always help set you on a good road to quick recovery. You will experience a little pain but speak up and it can soon be eased. At the end of the day it will be worth it!"
},{title:"Six Pack Abs The Big Picture",body:"The point of this article is to help you grasp the big picture of getting six pack abs.\n\nIn short, to get six pack abs, you need to get leaner and develop your abs’ musculature. This is done through training and nutrition. The topic of nutrition is covered extensively elsewhere on the net: I won’t delve in it.\n\nTraining-wise, to build six pack abs, you must combine cardio exercise, weightlifting, and abdominal exercises. All three are important, and to really get results you must do all three.\n\nCardio makes you leaner, which is necessary if you want your abs to show.\n\nWeightlifting makes you leaner, too, by increasing your resting metabolic rate and the amount of calories you burn at rest. Good weightlifting routines for fat loss are also available elsewhere online. I recommend Lyle McDonald’s Ultimate Diet 2.0 (which integrates nutrition and training for superior results: best for serious trainees) and Craig Ballantyne’s Turbulence Training (this one is more beginner-friendly).\n\nFinally, abdominal exercises are needed to define your abs and give them the six pack look.\n\nSimple enough? OK, let’s get serious.\n\nCardio comprises long, slow cardio and interval training. To get six pack abs quickly, the best approach is to do both. Since interval training is better than long, slow cardio, if you’re short on time, do interval training only.\n\nAbdominal exercises can be divided according to which area they put the emphasis on. All exercises activate the whole abdominal region, but each one targets a specific area more than the others. They can put the emphasis on the upper and middle abs, the lower abs, or the side abs.\n\nSo where do we go from there? Well, to sum up, to get six pack abs you need good nutrition (covered elsewhere) and effective training (including cardio, weightlifting, and abdominal exercises). Cardio comprises long, slow cardio and interval training, whereas abdominal exercises can target the upper and middle, lower, or side abs.\n\nThe web has a few good sources of information on these topics-I mentioned some. But searching the web is a hassle. If you value your time, want quality instructions, and would like to get six pack abs sooner rather than later take a look at my six pack abs solution below. It gets results-guaranteed."},{title:"Restorative Dentist New York",body:"No one likes to have teeth that are not bright and white.

But knowing the right procedure can help you to avoid unwanted rashes and acne. Everybody has a different skin type, so knowing which hair removal method suits your skin is important.\n\nThe different methods of hair removal are:\n\nShaving: With the help of a razor, you can cut off the tip of the hair shaft which has grown out through the skin. You can get disposable razors, razors with disposable blades, and also electric razors. Men use these razors to shave their faces, and women use them to shave their underarms, legs, and bikini areas. Always use blades with safety guard wires to minimize nicks and cuts on your skin.\n\nShaving is an inexpensive method. You can do it yourself; all you need is a razor and a shaving gel. But this method can cause burns, cuts, and bumps on your skin, and can be rather uncomfortable. Even ingrown hairs occur, as while shaving the hairs are cut below the level of the skin, so when the hair grows back, it grows within the surrounding tissue and not out of the follicle. The hair curls around and starts growing into the skin, and irritation, redness, and swelling can occur at the hair follicle. Plucking: With the help of tweezers, you can pull the hair out from its root. You have to stretch the skin tightly, grip the hair close to the base, and then pull it out. Plucking will last for about 3 to 5 weeks. Though this is time consuming, it is inexpensive, as you do not have to go anywhere to get it done. It can be painful, and you may notice temporary red bumps, as the hair follicle gets swollen and irritated.\n\nDepilatories: Depilatories are hair removal creams or liquids. This is an easy method, as depilatories can remove hair from the skin’s surface. They work by reacting with the protein structure of the hair, so the hair dissolves and can be washed or wiped away. It can last up to 2 weeks. They are easily available and are inexpensive. You can use it on your legs, underarms, and bikini areas. It has a bad odor though, and some people can even have an allergic reaction to it, which may cause rashes or inflammation. People with sensitive skin should be careful.\n\nWaxing: In this method, a sticky wax is spread on your skin, and then a cloth strip is applied over the wax and quickly pulled off, taking the hair root and dead skin cells with it. Normally the wax should be warmed, but some can be applied cold. It can be done at a salon or at home. Waxing makes the area smooth and is long lasting. It lasts for about 3 to 5 weeks. The hair regrowth also looks lighter than it does after other methods of hair removal such as shaving. This can be a painful procedure and you may even get bumps and inflammation after waxing, but the result you get is worth the pain. Professional waxing is also expensive compared to other hair removal methods. Diabetic patients and those under acne treatment should avoid this method. Electrolysis: In this method a professional electrologist would insert a needle into the hair follicle and send an electric current through the hair root to kill it. This gets done over a series of several appointments. It is a long procedure, and even a small area like the upper lip may take a total of 4 to 10 hours, and a larger area such as the bikini line may take 8 to 16 hours. This is a permanent method, but it is expensive and time consuming. The process can be painful, and dry skin, scabs, scarring, and inflammation may result after treatment. Laser: Here a laser would be directed through your skin to the hair follicle and stop growth. Large areas of skin can be treated at the same time. It can last up to 6 months. This method is best suited for light-skinned people having dark hair, as the melanin in the hair absorbs more of the light; thus making treatment more effective. The treatment can be expensive and may cost up to $500 or more.\n\nPrescription Treatments: Medicinal creams are available by prescription, such as eflornithine for treating facial hair growth. The cream is to be applied twice a day until the hair becomes softer and lighter. Side effects may include skin irritation and acne. Another method that doctors prescribe is antiandrogen medications to reduce the appearance of unwanted hair. Androgen hormone can be responsible for hair growth in unwanted areas, and antiandrogens can block the androgen production. It’s your personal choice whether or not you want to remove your body hair. Hair removal would not affect your health in any way, so you shouldn’t feel pressured to remove it if you don’t want to. But if you do wish to get rid of unwanted hair, choose a method that would suit you best. Remember that each person is beautiful in his/her own way, so always respect your body."},{title:"How To Become Top Fashion Designer",body:"You know you’re destined to be a fashion designer if you: a) spent most of your childhood making clothes for your Barbie dolls instead of playing with your friends; b) read fashion magazines instead of your school books; c) ran a boutique out of your basement at age 10. In other words: if you want to be the next Yves Saint Laurent, it helps to be completely and utterly obsessed with fashion.\n\nHowever, there are many aspects of the profession. Working as a fashion designer can just as well mean supervising a design team at a sportswear company as producing a label under your own name. Although the former career may not seem as glamorous as the latter, it certainly will make your life less stressful. To create your own label takes a lot of time, dedication and hard work. Not to mention living just above the poverty line for several years.\n\nChoosing a strategy\n\nThere are as many different ways to embark upon a fashion career as there are styles of design. Ralph Lauren’s Polo empire was founded on a small tie collection that he sold to Bloomingdales. Helmut Lang decided to open his own clothing store when he couldn’t find a t-shirt that he liked. Michael Kors built up a network of customers by selling clothes in a trendy NYC boutique. However, most people find that the best foundation for a design career is to get a fine arts degree in fashion at a prestigious school. Besides teaching you the craft, a good school will also add credibility to your resum      "},{title:"How To Use Eye Shadow Like The Stars",body:"Most people feel they have some basic flaws with their appearance, and the truth is that the stars are no exception. Beauties like Angelina Jolie and Beyonce Knowles make no secret of their use of various make-up styles to enhance their appearance, and both of these ladies make splendid use of eye shadow. Eye shadow is designed to attract attention to a person’s eyes (yes, male movie stars use it too!) and at the same time enhances the appearance of the eyes by detracting attention from or covering up minor flaws. Here are some tips on how to apply eye shadow in order that it fixes some of the flaws you may believe are there.\n\nTo maximize the effect of your eye shadow, you will want to make sure that people are aware that you have it on. Some beauty experts suggest “priming” your eyes before applying the shadow. The eye lids are a lighter shade than the skin on the rest of the face, due mainly to their lessened exposure to light overt the course of a lifetime. A layer of bone shadow over your lids will even up the coloring with the rest of the face, and any color you apply on top of that will tend to stand out.\n\nNext, experiment with several shades before you decide on the right one for you. A bronze colored eye shadow works for most eyes, and other shades will depend on the color of your own eyes. Blue eyes, for example, will be best complemented with a deeper shade of blue (this will make your own eye color pop out and look extra blue), taupe, violet, or gray. Lighter shades and contrasts work great for brown eyes, while green eyes are bedazzling with the similar shades that are slightly deeper.\n\nDon’t be afraid to try a funky look with your eye shadow. Silvery, sparkly colors can look great and will have an undeniably exotic appeal. Try to match your scheme with your eye color or outfit, and make sure you get some good feedback before trying it out in public!\n\nFinally, there are several techniques that can be used in order to correct the minor flaws you may see in the appearance of your eyes. If you think your eyes are too far apart, you can make them appear closer together by emphasizing the inner corner of your eye. Put more shadow on this area and blend it outwards towards the rest of the eye. Eyes that are too close together can gain the impression of distance by darkening the outer edges of your eye and keeping the inner corners light. Again, make sure to blend the colors so that the emphasis is not apparent. If you want your eyes to look bigger, use a lighter color of eye shadow.\n\nEye shadow is a great way to change your appearance with a multi-use product that does not cost too much and whose application can be mastered by most individuals. Keep you eyes noticeable, and you will be noticed!"},{title:"Cultured Pearls As A Gift",body:"Almost every woman loves pearls. They exude timeless elegance. Pearl jewelry gives a woman the look of grandeur and the shimmering white of the pearls against the body feels awesome. Purity is compared to a pearl, because of the flawless whiteness of the pearl.\n\nYou would have bought cultured pearls for yourself or for a family member or friends, but do you know what exactly a cultured pearl is?  There is also a wrong notion that a cultured pearl is an artificial pearl. \n\nWhen something like a parasite or some organic matter gets implanted in an oyster or mollusk, a pearl is formed. These are called natural pearls as they are formed by nature. A cultured pearl is something that has the intervention of humans. A pearl farmer inserts a similar object into the oyster or mollusk and the pearl that is thus formed is called a cultured pearl. The rest of the process remains the same. The only difference being implanting the organic matter into the oyster. The size of the pearl, either natural or cultured depends on the length of time it remains in the oyster. The larger the size, the more valuable is the pearl.  All these cultured pearls are grown on pearl farms.\n\nCultured pearls are very valuable jewels in today’s world. No jewelry box looks complete without cultured pearl jewelry. Just like natural pearls, each cultured pearl is different from one another. The value of the cultured pearl depends on the color, size, shape, and luster. The brightness and luster of the cultured pearl speaks volumes about the quality. A cultured pearl should be flawless without any marks on it. It should be round without any dents. The roundness of the cultured pearl determines the price.  Cultured pearls are found in various colors, white, black, rose, cream, blue, yellow, green, mauve, gray, and lavender. The Indian rose-colored pearl is very famous and most-liked.  The color of the pearl is determined by the oyster or mollusk and their environment.  Think of the rainbow and you will find all those colors in cultured pearls. Did you know that pearl is the birthstone of people born under the Gemini star sign. Mystical powers and healing ability is associated with pearls. \n\nThere are several types of cultured pears, like Oriental pearls that are saltwater pearls and freshwater pearls that come from freshwater mollusks or oysters. Freshwater cultured pearls are less expensive and are more affordable for people on a budget. Cultured pearls are not as durable as gemstones. They need to be handled and stored with a lot of care. You should keep them away from humidity or dryness. Do not spray perfumes or let your cultured pearls come in touch with your makeup. That is the reason why they say, cultured pearls should be the last jewelry to be worn when dressing up. After removing them, it would do them good to wipe clean with a clean and soft cloth before storing the cultured pearls in a soft velvet pouch. \n\nCultured pearls make perfect gifts for loved ones. All sorts of jewelry is made with cultured pearls, from plain pearl strands to pearls set in gold or other precious metals, or in combination with other precious gemstones. Cultured pearls give beauty to any jewelry they are set in. Pearls look extremely elegant on elderly women too and give them a dignified and sophisticated look, more than any other metal can. A plain strand of expensive pearls can be a lovely and thoughtful gift."},{title:"Ready To Wear Bifocal Contact Lenses",body:"Long years ago, you have to wear two sets of eye glasses, then doctors discovered the lens at the bifocal eye-glasses ,then recently they do the same thing in a bifocal contact lens. The lens is divided into two halves ,one upper and the other is lower and sometimes it can be in concentric circles ,one lens on the interior part and the other is on the outside part.\n\nWho need bifocal lenses?\n\nPeople who suffer from Presbyopia that causes trouble focusing on objects which are near and this doesn’t develop after the age 40.They are nearsightedness and farsightedness and suffer from the eye-glasses that are usually with thick lenses and a line across them (they act as two lenses in one).These eye-glasses have several problems: First :They are heavy, Second: They are almost unattractive, Third: It is hard to adjust to them as you have to look up or look down .All these problems cause dizziness during adapting to these bifocal lenses .The only choice for these people for long years ago was the eye-glasses even after contact lenses came on the market.\n\nNow ,contact lenses offer bifocal contact lenses which are soft ,rigid and with gas permeable materials .It is dual lens ,as if you are wearing two sets of glasses at the same time.\n\nBy using a set of bifocal contact lenses ,your eye begins gradually to adjust to the difference of portions as the muscles of the eye coordinate and be trained automatically from and to the correct lens that is needed at this time .Example: If someone is reading ,so the vision has to be corrected to view the close things at this time ,so the pupil of the eye will be directed to the lens that correct the vision and light will be refracted into the angle of the retina that will help in close reading .But if you begin to look off at things which are far away-as looking to the sky-the focus of the eye will be directed at this time to the lens that assist you to see the distant thing .All of this is due to the different prescription lens of the contacts that have the ability to refract the light at different angles and correct the vision due to different viewing.\n\nWhich is better?

Metal brackets are smaller and less conspicuous; tooth-colored brackets blend with the color of teeth. Patients benefit from the use of NASA-developed technology: advanced “space-age” wires with built-in memory. The wires, which actually move the teeth under the orthodontist’s supervision, deliver a light, continuous pressure. When they reach mouth temperature, the wires become active and “remember” their original shape. As the wires attempt to return to that shape, they gently guide the teeth into their correct positions. When compared to materials used as recently as a decade ago, today’s high-tech materials can result in fewer and less frequent appointments, so patients require less time away from school or work, and the treatment time may be shorter.\n\nAccording to the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), more than 5 million people in the U.S. and Canada are receiving care from AAO members, dental specialists who graduated from dental school and completed a minimum of two to three years of university-based training in an accredited orthodontic residency program. More than 1 million of these orthodontic patients are adults. Many are in their 40s, 50s and beyond.\n\nTeeth tend to drift as people mature. Even those who were born with perfectly placed teeth can experience these unwanted changes. Many consult an orthodontist to rejuvenate their smile and get a healthy bite. Between 1994 and 2004, the number of adult patients grew by 37 percent. An estimated 63 percent of adult patients are women.\n\nBut some things never change. Orthodontic patients need to follow their orthodontist’s instructions regarding elastic wear and good oral hygiene. Avoiding foods that are too hard, sticky, crunchy or chewy is also key. Such foods can damage braces, which may lengthen time spent in braces. Additionally, orthodontic patients need to see their dentist at least every six months for checkups and professional cleanings. Following these recommendations helps patients complete their treatment on time and with desired results."},{title:"Fast And Furious Facial",body:"It doesn’t matter if you are a stay at home mom, or a corporate professional. You need to keep your appearance at it’s best all the time, and that can be a hard job. But what if you don’t always have the time to go to a Spa for a professional facial? I’ve got just the solution for you.\n\nToday, many Spas provide what is know as MicroDermaBrasion. With this technique, a Spa technician exfoliates the dead layers of skin from your face by using a system similar to sandblasting, but on a much, much smaller scale. With the dead layers of skin removed from your face, it now reveals the fresh new skin underneath. This can give you the appearance of a face lift, without the cost or the surgery.\n\nMost women who undergo MicroDermaBrasion, find that afterwards their skin is sensitive, irritated, and sometimes swollen. Not to mention a professional Spa treatment takes a appointment, and can cost generally between $150 -$600 dollars. So what can you do for yourself that’s just as effective, is quick, and not expensive at all? It’s called a lemon salt scrub. Here’s what you will need.\n\nIngredients:\n\nOne Small Lemon\n\nFour Tablespoons of Fine Sea Salt\n\nIf you don’t have a lemon, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice is fine, and if you can’t get hold of finely ground sea salt, table salt will do as well.\n\nCut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice of one half into a small bowl. Then put the four tablespoons of fine sea salt in, and mix well. You want a solution with the consistency of oatmeal. Then take a few fingertip full of the solution and rub in into your face and pores, making sure to scrub gently as you go. Leave on for five to ten minutes, then wash off with cold water.\n\nYou will find your skin is softer and smoother than before, with a nice warm glow, and it cost you less than a few dollars, and no more than 15 minutes from start to finish to obtain. Now you can duplicate at home, or anywhere for that matter, what the Spas charge so much money to provide, at a fraction of the cost, and look great doing it!"},{title:"What Curling Irons Are The Best Ones",body:"With all of the styling tool options available in today’s market, it can be very confusing to choose the best curling iron for your hair. I mean, let’s face it; most curling irons claim to be the best buy, but are they really? So, what should you really look for in a curling iron and what should you avoid?\n\nWhen choosing the best curling iron for your hair, you should discount everything that companies say about their product in order to market it. I mean, they have a vested interest in selling more curling irons, so who would believe what they had to say anyway? But you should pay attention to what is written on the packaging in the small letters.\n\nThe first thing that you should look for is a thermostat controlled heat setting. This feature will allow you to select the temperature of the curling iron and set it according to how much heat you need to style your hair. You see, not all hair can withstand the same amount of heat. Some hair types, like fine hair, can only withstand minimal heat while coarse hair may need more intense heat to achieve any curl. So, choosing a curling iron without this setting could result in more damage than is necessary or styles that are hard to achieve and maintain.\n\nAnother thing that you should pay attention to is what type of material the barrel is made out of. On most irons, the barrel is made of metal, but you can find irons that are velvet covered and ceramic plated. Velvet covered irons are great for hair that is easily snagged and broken. Ceramic plated irons work to infuse moisture into the hair strands while it is being curled. For the most part, a metal barreled iron will do and these are the least expensive. But if your hair is damaged or dull, you might want to spend a little extra for the ceramic-plated iron. The first thing to wear out on a curling iron is usually the cord. This is because the cord is put under a lot of pressure at the point where it connects with the curling iron when you move the iron this way and that. To get an iron that lasts, choose an iron with a swivel cord connection. This type of cord will move as you move thus reducing the stress to the inner wires.\n\nSo, the next time you choose to buy a curling iron, pay less attention to the brand name and pomp surrounding a particular iron and look for features that you really need."

Emu oil was discovered by Aborigines many thousands of years ago as a skin moisturizer, antiseptic, and as an aid in the relief of sunburn, muscular aches and joint pain, as well as aiding in the healing of injuries. The emu oil is rendered from a thick layer of fat on the back yielding 5 – 7 liters of unsaturated, non-toxic, highly penetrating oil. Over ten years of research done at Global Canyon Ranch (Texas) has revealed that the emu oil has unique thermodynamic properties. Combined with other ingredients, the oil can be used to machine stainless steel much more rapidly, thus considerable savings in labor results. The emu oil is the greatest emollient in the world. It penetrates the skin better than mink or any other natural oil, and lacks long chain fatty acids which is conducive to a long shelf-life. Emu Oil is considered a complete source of essential fatty acids. Essential Fatty Acids (EFA’s) are fats that humans cannot manufacture or synthesize. We must obtain them from our diet. Like vitamins and minerals they are essential to the body’s functions. Incredibly, this amazing oil contains omega 3,6,9 essential fatty acids and is a powerful skin moisturizer and possesses strong anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nEmu Oil for Anti Wrinkle.\n\nBillions of Microscopic Three-Dimensional Nanoprisms! Here’s “so what.” Almost nobody knows this… but… the human eye cannot see a wrinkle. What the eye sees is actually the shadow made by the wrinkle. And, since all those billions of microscopic nanoprisms refract light. This effect will last until you wash your face and the invisible silicon dioxide is removed. And get this: Remember how I told you the main ingredient in this cosmetic cream is made from emu oil? Well, it turns out emu oil is probably the best cosmetic ingredient in the world. That’s because its molecules are much smaller than the molecules in human skin.\n\nPenetrate Down Through Seven Layers of Human Skin!"},{title:"Is The Herbal Way The Right Way",body:"More and more people are opting to live the herbal life: moving away from chemicals and scientific medicines, and taking traditional herbs to do everything from losing weight to relieving pain. They are often remedies that have been used in communities for hundreds or even thousands of years, and have now been taken for sale worldwide because of the people’s claims about their powers.\n\nThe last few decades have seen an explosion in the popularity of herbs and alternative medicine in general, as people increasingly seek miracle cures that can help them when their doctor or regular pharmacy cannot. The connection to traditional communities also appeals to those who want to go back to a more spiritual, myth-based way of life, instead of testing everything in a laboratory. It is also often believed that using herbs instead of chemicals can avoid the potential side effects of putting lots of synthetic substances into the body.\n\nMany people, however, say that herbal remedies are just a load of mumbo-jumbo, designed to sell gullible people some useless plants at premium prices. When the herbs do have some effect, it is put down to them being a placebo. This means that the act of taking the herb that makes you feel like you should feel better, and so you do, even if there was nothing in the herb itself to make that happen.\n\nMost scientists, however, do not hold extreme opinions either for or against the herbal lifestyle, instead preferring to study each herb to see which are useless and which may actually have some benefit. This leads to the situation where many herbal shops stock herbs that have been proven to do nothing side-by-side with ones that do – a situation that is often criticised, with many calling for greater regulation of herbal medicines. Taking the wrong herbs can even be dangerous to some people, especially people who are already taking prescribed medicines."},{title:"Six Pack Abs The Big Picture",body:"The point of this article is to help you grasp the big picture of getting six pack abs.\n\nIn short, to get six pack abs, you need to get leaner and develop your abs’ musculature. This is done through training and nutrition. The topic of nutrition is covered extensively elsewhere on the net: I won’t delve in it.\n\nTraining-wise, to build six pack abs, you must combine cardio exercise, weightlifting, and abdominal exercises. All three are important, and to really get results you must do all three.\n\nCardio makes you leaner, which is necessary if you want your abs to show.\n\nWeightlifting makes you leaner, too, by increasing your resting metabolic rate and the amount of calories you burn at rest. Good weightlifting routines for fat loss are also available elsewhere online. I recommend Lyle McDonald’s Ultimate Diet 2.0 (which integrates nutrition and training for superior results: best for serious trainees) and Craig Ballantyne’s Turbulence Training (this one is more beginner-friendly).\n\nFinally, abdominal exercises are needed to define your abs and give them the six pack look.\n\nSimple enough? OK, let’s get serious.\n\nCardio comprises long, slow cardio and interval training. To get six pack abs quickly, the best approach is to do both. Since interval training is better than long, slow cardio, if you’re short on time, do interval training only.\n\nAbdominal exercises can be divided according to which area they put the emphasis on. All exercises activate the whole abdominal region, but each one targets a specific area more than the others. They can put the emphasis on the upper and middle abs, the lower abs, or the side abs.\n\nSo where do we go from there? Well, to sum up, to get six pack abs you need good nutrition (covered elsewhere) and effective training (including cardio, weightlifting, and abdominal exercises). Cardio comprises long, slow cardio and interval training, whereas abdominal exercises can target the upper and middle, lower, or side abs.\n\nThe web has a few good sources of information on these topics-I mentioned some. But searching the web is a hassle. If you value your time, want quality instructions, and would like to get six pack abs sooner rather than later take a look at my six pack abs solution below. It gets results-guaranteed."},{title:"Restorative Dentist New York",body:"No one likes to have teeth that are not bright and white.

There are several active ingredients that have been clinically proven to be effective skin rejuvenators. One of the most effective treatments is vitamin A derivatives such a retinol or retinyl palmitate. \n\nThe Retin A or Renova vitamin A treatments are the strongest although the most irritating treatments of the vitamin A options and are only available by prescription. If your skin needs major rejuvenation attention, ask your Doctor if you are a candidate for the prescription vitamin A treatment of Retin A or Renova. If not, including one of the other retinol alternatives in your skin care routine is an excellent strategy. The concentration of over-the-counter retinol products can range up to 1%. The basic rule of thumb is, the higher the concentration, the stronger the treatment. Be forewarned though, read the directions carefully because the stronger retinol products can be quite irritating to the skin. Starting slow and gradually working your way up to higher concentrations will allow your skin to adjust to the treatments better. The vitamin A derivative, Retinyl Palmitate, is the less irritating of the Vitamin A options and is considered to have quite effective rejuvenating qualities. The next most beneficial anti-aging skin rejuvenation treatment is a chemical exfoliant such as an alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA) or beta hydroxyl acid (BHA) product. The most popular of these acids is an AHA glycolic acid. Glycolic acid should be use in concentrations of 8% to 15% depending on your skin’s sensitivity. Start out with a lower concentration and gradually move up to a 10% then 15% concentration depending on your skin’s tolerance in order to avoid irritation. \n\nFinally, the most critical and essential aspect to any successful skin rejuvenation regime is sunscreen, at least once a day, each and every day!"},{title:"Knowing What Moisturizer To Use Is Knowing About Your Skin Part 1",body:"If we look back in history, it seems pretty obvious that human beings care about their skin. And why shouldn’t we? As the largest organ of the body, the epidermis (the scientific name for skin) serves an extremely important role of keeping the bodies’ moisture in while keeping foreign material out. It does this by having a protective layer of lipids that coat the body and protect the top layer of skin. When we work and play in our daily lives, the daily activities will often strip our skin of this protective layer. This is why the skin can benefit from the use of a moisturizer at times. Moisturizers contain oil-soluble molecules that help to restore the skin to its natural condition. There are hundreds of different moisturizers from manufacturers that promise to do everything from restoring your face’s natural moisture to making age lines and wrinkles disappear. If a product can really do this, wouldn’t it be in your best interest to get the best possible brand to enhance your skin? Is there really a difference in all these different products? Don’t they all basically just do the same thing? If all of our skin was exactly the same that would probably be the case. Unfortunately, the skin is a complex organ that has specific properties that are unique to each of us. Therefore one kind of moisturizer can definitely be more effective than another when it comes to treating our own special skin qualities. Knowing what goes in all these products is the key to choosing the type of moisturizer that best fits your skin type.\n\nMost moisturizers are a combination of oil and water soluble parts called an emulsion. More recent advances include vesicles, microscopic bubbles made of biological components. These components are useful in restoring the skin’s protective layer and also carry active ingredients inside the cells. The correct use of moisturizers is important for people with dermatologic disease. Improper application of a product could lead to a worsening of the condition.\n\nMoisturizers claim that they can restore and heal the skin but there is not a very clear definition of exactly what dry skin is. The symptoms include dry and uncomfortable sensations that include pain, itchiness, stinging, and tingling and a rough surface. Redness may also be apparent. More severe cases include dry, white patches on the skin that is flaky or cracked in appearance."},{title:"Welcome To The Online Best Model Winner Contest At Lookoftheyear",body:"How many times you have been complimented for your skin or your beautiful face by your friends?

Skin dryness is caused not only by moisture loss from the skin’s outer layer, but also from a lack of moisture moving upward from the underlying layers of the skin. Applying a moisturizer softens and moisturizes the top layer of skin, but the effects are only temporary.\n\nTo have soft, pliable, moist skin, you need to lubricate your skin from the inside. Drink at least six glasses of pure water daily and eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits to keep your body tissues well-hydrated. Don’t wait to drink until you are thirsty because by then you are already dehydrated. Instead, keep a container of water handy for sipping throughout the day. If you find plain water boring, try making unsweetened or lightly sweetened herbal teas such as linden flower, chamomile, or mint.\n\nA moist external environment also provides moisture for your skin and helps to keep cells plump. Use a humidifier during the winter months to counteract the drying effects of indoor heating and also during the summer if you use air conditioning or if you live in a dry climate. Misting your skin frequently with pure mineral water or a facial mist containing floral waters and aromatherapy essential oils provides an immediate and refreshing boost of moisture for your skin throughout the day. Soaking in a warm bath is an effective way of hydrating the skin of your entire body. Avoid excessively hot water, because it can remove protective oils from your skin. After a 15-minute soak, massage your body with an aromatherapy oil while you are still wet from the bath, and then gently pat your skin dry with a towel. The thin layer of aromatherapy oil acts as a protective barrier that prevents the evaporation of moisture that your skin has absorbed from the bath."},{title:"Great Benefits Of Natural Skin Care Products",body:"Natural skin care products are the safest and the most effective means to maintain the good health of your skin. For ages, nature has provided the medical industry with ingredients that have powerful antibiotic, antiseptic, or anti-inflammatory properties which are processed into medicines, serums, ointments, or lotions.\n\nNatural dermatological products are mostly found in the form of ointments or creams, which are quickly absorbed by the superficial layers of the skin. They are effective against most skin conditions and successfully treat local irritation or rashes. The main advantage of using natural skin care products is their hypo-allergenic character; they are proved to be very well tolerated by the skin. This is due to the fact that natural products contain no additives or preservatives and therefore they are very safe and reliable. In addition, natural skin care products that are properly formulated to match a specific skin care need often cost no more than their synthetic opponents.\n\nIt is known for a fact that chemically enhanced products may harm your body by releasing malign substances into the blood stream. In order to minimize these risks, you should consider using natural skin care products instead. They stand as a very effective and healthy alternative to all synthetic products. However, the main disadvantage of all natural skin care products is that they tend to lose their properties sooner; they have a shorter period of life. Unlike products that are chemically processed and contain synthetic preservatives, natural products alter more quickly, and therefore you should always make sure you check the expiration date before buying such natural skin care products from the shelves of pharmacies or supermarkets.  Sometimes, regardless of their nature, skin care products only treat the effects of a disease, and not the factors that are causing it. Take acne, for instance. Skin acne is not always an infectious disease. It may be caused by hormonal unbalances inside the body and the unaesthetic aspect of the skin is due to the excessive oil produced by the seborrheic glands. In order to successfully treat this very common skin condition, an internal treatment must be associated to the topic external antibiotics. Well tolerated natural skin care products in the form of creams or lotions applied on the affected skin then complete the treatment by controlling the condition externally.\n\nTherefore, if you have skin affection, you should pay a visit to your dermatologist first and ask for advice regarding the appropriate treatment. Natural skin care products come as an addition to the prescribed treatment, enhancing its benefic results. Also, it is very important to check if the skin care products you choose are appropriate for your skin type before using them. \n\nDespite their successful use among the medical branches, natural skin care products are not exclusively intended for treating skin conditions! They are also very efficient for cosmetic purposes. As a matter of fact, the cosmetic industry offers nowadays a wide range of natural products that improve the aesthetics of skin. Anti aging skin care products are the most popular at the time being. Whether they are intended for preventing or reversing the natural aging process of the skin, such products are highly requested and are “a must have” particularly among women in their mid-thirties. Anti aging skin care products, as well as other cosmetics, satisfy the growing aesthetic needs of modern society.\n\nRegardless of their purposes, natural skin care products are the best alternative for synthetic ones, and when properly used, their beneficial actions are quickly noticeable."},{title:"Tips For Eye Make Up",body:"When it comes to eye make-up you need to think and then apply because eyes talk louder than words.

One of the popular versions is the bareFaced mineral shadow/liners, which consist of highly pigmented mineral make-up powders. It consists of ingredients like Titanium Dioxide, Serecite, Mica, ferric ferrocyanide and Iron Oxide. These shadows can be used on the eyelid for that stunning effect. There was a time when to get the perfect eye shadow, you had to mix and match dozens of eye shadow powder shades to find the perfect effect but things have changed now.

These eye shadow powders have a distinct advantage: they are easy to use and you can do it anywhere and anytime. All you need is a applicator brush and some foam pads.

Most cream shadows are available in squeeze tubes and you can apply them on the lid as well as close to the brows.\n\nMascara\n\nEyes without mascara can be quite dull and boring at times while too much will take away the life from the eyes so you will need to use it with care.

Almost every style involved some sort of hair accessory or embellishment to really set it off. Today, the hair accessory is not a part of everyday style and care should be taken as to when and how to use the hair accessory so that you will not look dated.\n\nWith that said, there are some occasions that scream for hair accessories: Work, social occasions and formal events may all have you searching for the perfect hair accessory to set off your look. While different occasions will call for different hair accessories, a good rule of thumb to follow is to choose the sedate hair accessory over one that could not go unnoticed in a crowd of a few hundred or a few thousand.\n\nWhile choosing the right one can be tricky, there are a few pointers that you can follow to help you pick the perfect hair accessories to complete your look. Here are just a few:\n\n”	Work. In many work situations, you will likely have to wear your hair up. No matter if your type of employment requires it or you simply like to change your look now and then, wearing your hair up calls for the right hair accessory to do the job. The number one rule to finding the right hair accessory for work is to avoid banana clips at all costs. I mean, who still makes these things? Apparently they’re making money at it or they wouldn’t still be producing these torture devices of the 80s. Don’t further their cause: stop buying this hair accessory. The second rule is to choose hair accessories that closely match your hair color or that blend nicely with it. Matching a hair accessory to your clothes is only cute when you are 5-years-old. What you choose will depend largely on your length of hair and how you like to wear your hair up. For French twists, choose hair accessories that resemble over-sized hair clips. Simply twist and clip. \n\n”	Social and formal occasions. In social and formal occasions you have a greater opportunity to express your artsy side through hair accessories. Again choose sedate pieces over garish hair accessories. Classy pieces can be perfect for social occasions, whereas a little sprig of flowers or garnishment may be needed for formal occasions. Formal occasions are the only time that is okay to match your hair accessory to your clothing. But still, do not go overboard. What attracts the eye should be the beauty of your hair, not too-busy hair accessories. If in doubt about what hair accessory or how much of it to include, opt for the simple solution: use as little as possible.\n\nThe bottom line with hair accessories is that too much of a good thing can confuse the eye and make your do look garish. Simple hair accessories, on the other hand, can make a bold beauty statement that makes your hair the talk of the office or party."

Because of its many therapeutic uses, it is now commercially cultivated in the United States, Japan, and countries in the Caribbean and Mediterranean. However, in many places you can grown your own Aloe Vera plant quite happy in a pot as a household plant.\n\nDespite its very cactus-like characteristics, Aloe belongs to the lily family, which also includes asparagus, onions, leeks and garlic. The Aloe plant contains over thirty enzymes, including lipase and oxidase. It could be argued that enzymes are the missing element in the modern diet since 40% of the adult population suffer digestive problems and digestion is enzyme-based.\n\nAloe Vera also contains significant levels of salicylic acid (the active ingredient in aspirin) which accounts for some of the herb’s pain-killing potential. Some people swear by a burst of aloe spray on sunburn when a gel or cream is too painful to apply.\n\nSalicylic acid also plays a role in Aloe’s detoxifying and cell-cleansing capacity. The well-researched capacity of Aloe to stimulate the immune system is arguably its most important attribute. Others have testified that a daily drink with high quality Aloe juice helps clear sensitive skin. Aloe is well known as a soothing ingredient in skincare lotions and body products.\n\nThere are a host of studies from every continent documenting the healthful benefits of Aloe Vera, taken both internally and used externally.

If you do an internet search online, you will find an amazing number of web sites and articles dedicated to that very topic. You can find everything from articles on wacky and wild hair styles, to specific and serious articles on what kind of style for what shaped face you have. The possibilities are nearly endless.\n\nOne of the most common desires for people seeking information about hair styles is what to do when you have a “long” face. This is particularly an issue with some people who have really proportionately large foreheads. There are a lot of options for someone who has this particular problem. Someone with straight hair can create the appearance of more width by using bangs. Chin-length bobs and cuts can also be effective options because they also work well to create an effective illusion of width. Curls and waves also add width, but for general appearance sake it might be wise to avoid short layers that add volume on top. Bangs can make your face appear shorter because they cover up large foreheads.\n\nWhile these are all positive options, there are some styles that you will need to avoid. Any type of style that involves extremely long hair or extremely short hair will end up elongating your face, which you are looking to avoid in the first place. If a long face is not a problem, you may want to consider looking for a style that involves long, curly hair. There are very few looks that turn the head more than long, curly hair. If you are a girl with long curly hair, and you are having trouble with “frizzing,” one way to stop that is to not brush your curls. Take the time to use your fingers to break up curls, or you will continue to have the problems you are already facing.\n\nThere are many magazines and e-zines dedicated specifically to these types of hair care topics. For each person, there is a different style. Find pictures, and try to imagine each look on you. Does it accentuate your best features? Does it hide the worst? Do you like it? That is the best and most important decision. If you like your hair, your attitude will show and it is attitude that attracts other people’s attention more than anything else. Remember that, and if you find a style that works in your eyes, it will work for everyone else, as well."},{title:"Recommended You To Use After Before Breast Enhancement",body:"You should be able to find several indispensable facts about After-Before Breast Enhancement in the following paragraphs.

Therefore, selecting a size of breast implant that you would like the surgeon to place inside your chest is an important decision. It is recommended you to use after-before breast enhancement pictures to make your decision. \n\nIt’s really a good idea to probe a little deeper into the subject of After-Before Breast Enhancement. What you learn may give you the confidence you need to venture into new areas. Every female who would like to breast enlargement might already be thinking of her dream breast size. She might be aware that her A-cup bra size chest is too small for her height and frame, thus making her self-conscious. Some women joke about looking at other women’s chest in order to determine what size they would like. But every skilled plastic surgeon would have after-before breast enhancement pictures of previous breast enlargement surgeries they have completed. It is suggested that you not only browse through these after-before breast enhancement pictures to get an idea of the size you like, but also to view how skilled the doctor may be. A bra size is achieved by taking two measurements. The first measurement that is determined involves placing the measuring tape around the area under your breasts. Five inches is added to this number and this will give you the width of the bra you should buy, e.g. 32, 34, 36. The second measurement taken is around the widest part of the chests. Subtracting these two measurements and looking on a standard chart will give your cup size, which can range from AA to DD or higher. Therefore, based on this information and looking at after-before breast enhancement pictures, you should be able to decide if it is a good idea to move from an AA cup size to a DD cup size. \n\nPueraplus is a premuim grade Thai traditional herbal formula derived mainly from White Kwao Krua (Pueraria Mirifica) which contains Phytoestrogens (Natural Plant Estrogen).

You are going to be the center of attention (at long last!) as all eyes will be on you and your groom. Even though your friends and family are there to cheer you on and celebrate the great day along with you, it can still be incredibly nerve wracking to have to stand in front of them all and try desperately to look your best.\n\nSo many things need to be taken into consideration: your dress, shoes, underwear (you know it), hair, skin, makeup. With all the planning and preparations, no one will blame you if a detail goes wrong, but it is likely that you do not want to take that risk. To be sure that your makeup is the best it can possibly be, go with a trusted makeup artist and have a trial run before the wedding day.\n\nThere are a few other things to consider when it comes to keeping the makeup firmly on your face, however!\n\nHave a chat with your makeup artist if you have any concerns, and he or she should calmly walk you through the best possible options. Some of the most important things for you to consider when it comes to your wedding day makeup are color, moisturizer, wet eyes, facial treatments and emergency supplies.\n\nFirst off, colors. Do not leave this to chance, be sure to match your makeup to your dress, accessories and surroundings! The last thing you want is for your color scheme to be sketchy…you may never forgive yourself. Seriously, it is something that needs to be considered so that you avoid a last minute color clash between yourself and the lovely flower arrangements all around the altar. Show all theme samples to your makeup artist and he or she can keep the colors in mind, choosing products that will both highlight your facial features while complementing the wedding scene beautifully.\n\nThe next thing to consider is moisturizer. Application of good moisturizer is always important, so let your wedding day be no different. Makeup will last longer if it is applied to a smooth, hydrated face, so be sure to apply plenty in the week coming up to your wedding day. On the day itself, apply your moisturizer a good twenty minutes before having your makeup done, so that it has a chance to absorb properly and benefit the makeup.\n\nWet eyes are always a problem for the bride, even ones who think they are made of stone. No woman should be expected to go through an entire wedding ceremony, the speeches and wedding night without shedding a tear! (hopefully for sentimental reasons) Keep this in mind and plan ahead. Make sure that you are having waterproof mascara put on your lashes, and oil based concealers and foundations around your eyes. You most certainly do not want streaming black lines running down your face if worst comes to worst and you break down in tears!\n\nWhen it comes to facial treatments, these can do wonders for your skin and if you want to be sure you have no silly imperfections on the big day it is a good idea to book one of these for yourself. If you already use these services regularly, then great! Just remember that as with most treatments, your skin can be red and sensitive immediately afterwards, so do not plan your facial too close to the wedding day. If you can, book a week or even a month ahead, depending on your skin type."},{title:"Forehead Lift Brow Lift Temporal Lift Forhead Rejuvenation",body:"Brow lift\n\nSignificant number of patients that comes to our office presents with concerns about the aperance of their upper face. They commonly complain that they are often told that they look tired, sad or even angry when they don’t feel these emotions. This people usually attribute this negative emotional state with the appearance of their upper eye lids and will usually request for upper blepharoplasty. This false perception of psychological pessimism of the face is due to the appearance of the upper eye lid which is affected by the brow position. The eyebrow which is a distinguishing portion of our forehead, contain hair follicle. The human eye that includes the eyebrow and eyelid is responsible for expressing one’s non verbal emotions. The contour, shape and position of the eyebrow can suggest sadness, anger, confusion and alertness. The eyebrows droop down as a person ages, this causes fullness and hooding of the upper eye lid. This change of the brow position is often accompanied by deep transverse lines of the forehead, vertical lines at the glabelar area and crow’s feet at the lateral side of the eyes.\n\nThe eyebrows position can be altered surgically to help change the patient’s facial expression; this is called forehead lift or brow lift. It can be lifted by excising the excess skin of the forehead through an incision behind or just along the hairline. But for some patient that heals well specially for Caucasians, the incision can be placed just above the eyebrows. The contour and shape of the eyebrows can also be altered by lifting the lateral half of eyebrow, to raise the brow upward and back to a more youthful position which executed through an incision at the temple area of the scalp. This is procedure is called temporal lift. All of these procedures also improve or soften the deep transverse lines at the forehead, crow’s feet at the sides of the eyes and frown lines over the glabelar area. Thus resulting in a more young and relaxed look. I often perform this as out patient procedure in our fully equip ambulatory surgical facility or patient may be admitted for a day or two if they prefer to have more comfort and relaxation immediately after the surgery. Weather the procedure will be performed as an Out-Patient or as a Hospital procedure, preoperative laboratory and medical clearance is required. The procedure will last for 60 to 90 min. Forehead lift or temporal lift can be done under deep sedation with local anesthesia or general anesthesia. Patients are required to wear tight dressing or compression garment for 1 to 2 week, and this will help the skin redrape to the muscle of the face, assist in controlling swelling and also prevent fluid to accumulation under the skin. There will be some swelling and mild bruising of the face that will last for several days to weeks. Sutures are removed 7 days after the surgery. Any patient planning to have this procedure will require 10 to 14 days for the initial consultation, laboratory, medical clearance, surgery; follow up, suture removal and early recuperation. After this patient is safe to travel since wounds are dry and healed.\n\nOther recomeded article:\n\nAffordable Cosmetic Surgery : Philippines Booming Medica Tourism Industry"},{title:"Dentists Are Smiling Over Painless Veneer Alternative",body:"Traditional methods of smile enhancement, like veneers, often have required painful hours in the dentist’s chair. “I have always been worried that we are doing damage, especially on young people, by taking away too much tooth structure,” says a North Carolina dentist in a posting on www.dentaltown.com, a popular dental Web site and forum. Now, with one of the newest developments in cosmetic dentistry, Lumineers by Cerinate, you can dramatically improve your smile immediately and painlessly.

While it is certainly nice that it keeps us rooted to the planet, it also has a habit of pulling things lower than we might like over time. Breast Lifts – Improvement Without Implants\n\nCosmetic breast surgery is one of the more popular areas of plastic surgery. That being said, the controversy surrounding breast implants may make you pause when considering the various enhancement procedures available. Breast lifts are designed to fight the effects of gravity. The goal of the procedure is to raise and/or reshape sagging breasts. When breast lifts are discussed, most people assume the procedure necessarily includes the use of implants. While it is true that implants can be used in the process, it is equally true that they need not be. Obviously, the choice comes down to the final result you hope to achieve and the advice of your physician. Regardless, it is important to understand that you should not assume a lift requires implants. Breast lifts without implants can make a major difference in your appearance. One has to be a bit careful discussing the procedure because it tends to be tailored to the specific situation of each patient. That being said, the process typically involves the removal of excess skin combined with the repositioning of the remaining tissues. In one sense, breast lift surgery is very much an artistic endeavor. The plastic surgeon is essentially acting as a sculptor. As such, you absolutely must make sure you are comfortable with their style and past creations. The best way to do this is to sit down with the surgeon and review before and after pictures from past procedures. This is your body, so do not hesitate to express your opinions and ask questions. The surgeon will not be insulted. To the contrary, he or she would rather have as detailed an understanding as possible of your goal. He or she can then give you an idea of potential, reasonable results. As Einstein told us, gravity is one of the key forces in the universe. A breast lift can give you the ability to counter that force without dealing with the controversy surrounding implants."},{title:"Lasik Eye Surgery Are You Ready",body:"Is Lasik in your future?\n\nMillions of Americans turn to Lasik Surgery when their vision is less than perfect and they’re tired of being tied down to wearing glasses or contacts.

Let’s review and clearly understand what these changes are that we must look for, recognize and then take steps to correct.\n\nSkin Texture Changes (Surface Irregularities)\n\nThe aged facial skin looks dry when compared to a child’s skin. Over half of the crucial natural skin moisturizing agent Hyaluronic Acid is lost by the time we turn 50 and you cannot replace HA by taking a pill or applying it to your skin. Loss of hormonal support during menopause accelerates this change. Dry aged skin loses its glow, looks dull, almost grey. The aged skin is wrinkled and rough and pore size is enlarged. Uneven pigmentation, brown spots, and red spots (Pigment and Blood vessels)\n\nUneven pigmentation and over growth of blood vessels are characteristic of aged facial skin. These blemishes are a protective and inflammatory response of the skin to years of exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun and injury from free radicals released by harmful agents in our environment and diet.\n\nFine Lines and Wrinkles\n\nFine lines and wrinkles are classic signs of facial aging. Static wrinkles are those that are present in the skin when the face is at rest. These wrinkles are caused by the loss of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin. Collagen is destroyed by UV light from the sun and free radicals from other sources. As the collagen disappears volume is lost beneath the skin and the skin wrinkles. This is not unlike the way a grape wrinkles after drying to produce a raisin.\n\nDynamic wrinkles are those that you see when the face is moving- frown lines, laugh lines, worry lines, and crow’s feet. These lines are actually caused by the pull of the facial muscles beneath the facial skin. Dynamic wrinkles can become static wrinkles after years of repeated pulling by the facial muscles.\n\nDeep Facial Lines\n\nDeep facial lines are those lines around the mouth called the Nasal-labial fold line and the Marionette lines. These lines are different from wrinkles in that they are caused by a combination of the pull of the facial muscles and loose sagging skin. As the face ages, the skin becomes loose and falls over the line created by the facial muscle pull, for example the smile line.\n\nLoose skin\n\nThe skin of the aged face has lost it’s elasticity and has become loose. The cheek has fallen and created loose skin on the jaw called jowls. The skin beneath the jaw on the neck is also hanging down, a phenomenon called the turkey wattle.\n\nWhat Is Facial Rejuvenation\n\nThe definition of rejuvenate is to make young or youthful again or restore to an original or new state. True facial rejuvenation requires correction of all of the above facial aging changes for the face to be made young or youthful or restored to an original state.

If you are, has your teen ever mentioned entering into a beauty pageant before? If she recently has, have you given her a decision yet? For many parents, their first though is “no way,” but you should know that beauty pageants are all not as bad as they seem.\n\nWhen it comes to determining whether or not you should let your teen enter a beauty pageant or even a number of them, you should know that there are a number of pros and cons to doing so. One of those pros or plus sides is the fact that it is something that your teenager wants to do. If your teenager was the one who brought up a beauty pageant then there is a good chance that it is something that interests them. \n\nAnother one of the many pros or plus sides to allowing your teen enter a beauty pageant or even a number of them is because of the rewards. What is nice about beauty pageants is that you don’t just get a trophy or a ribbon, but you also get a cash prize reward. Instead of cash, some beauty pageants even give out scholarships. If your child is interested in making their own money or if they are interested in going to college, a beauty pageant may actually be able to help them achieve their goals.\n\nWhile there are a number of pros to letting your teen enter into beauty pageants, there are also a number of cons or downsides to doing so as well. One of those downsides is the work that goes into attending beauty pageants. Now, if your teen was only interested in competing in a local pageant, this may not be as big of an issue for you. However, there are beauty pageant families out there who actually spend time traveling across the country participating in beauty pageants. While you and your teen can do this if you want, it often places a lot of stress, both emotional and financial, on all family members. \n\nAnother one of the cons or downsides to allowing your teen to participate in a beauty pageant is the results. Unfortunately, it seems as there is a stereotype associated with beauty pageants. Many individuals only believe that beauty pageants are for those who are breathtakingly beautiful or skinny. Perhaps, this is due in part to the fashion industry and many beauty pageant judges. Although your teen can participate in a beauty pageant if she wants to, no matter what her appearance is, it is something that you may want to take into consideration. For teens, there is nothing worse or more damaging to one’s self-esteem if they are told or made to feel as if they aren’t pretty or talented enough.\n\nIn keeping with the competition, your teen may find it quite difficult to jump right into beauty pageants. A good number of the teens who participate in beauty pageant have done so since they were a toddler or elementary school aged. While not always, these participants are often more likely to see success than someone who recently decided to enter a beauty pageant. Of course, that doesn’t mean that your teen can’t place high or even win a beauty pageant, but it does mean that they may have a lot of hard work ahead of them.\n\nThe above mentioned pros and cons are just a few of the many that exist. If your teen has recently asked you if they could take part in a beauty pageant, it is something that you and the rest of your family may want to seriously consider or at least closely examine."
},{title:"Types Of Cosmetics",body:"Make-up and cosmetics are used all over the world by all kinds of different people. Cosmetic products are defined as, “a substance or preparation intended for placement in contact with any external part of the human body”. This definition can include a variety of products. 	Shampoos and soaps are products that usually contain some kind of fragrance and clean the skin by the use of surface-active agents, or surfactants. These surfactants are molecules that have both lipophilic and hydrophilic, or fat soluble and water soluble parts. The fat soluble part of the product clings to the oil and dirt as the water soluble part allows the lipophilic part to be washed away. Detergents for dishes and clothes work in pretty much the same way but will have different ingredients that make them more harsh for use on hard, solid surfaces. It is usually not a good idea to try and use these detergents on the body and hair, for it can lead to irritation. 	Lipstick is another cosmetic product that contains hydrophilic properties. They are manufactured by combining wax, a non-volatile oil such as beeswax with castor oil, and water. The combination produces a thick substance that is water-insoluble and spreads easily on the lips. Because of its lipophilic properties, lipstick won’t dissolve on the lips when exposed to saliva or liquid from drinks. Other lipsticks will have a dye in them that react to amino acids on the top layer of the skin. This makes the the product appear blue or green in the container and change to red when applied to the lips. When water is lost on the top layer of dead skin cells faster than the living cells under them can absorb the moisture our skin becomes dry. This is when we need the help of a moisturizer. When the skin becomes dry and scaly, moisturizers can assist by preventing further water loss, known as occlusion, and by adding humectants, substances that increase the hydrophilic properties of the skin. Humectant moisturizers contain substances such as alpha hydroxy acids or glycerine and add moisture to the top layer of skin while occlusive moisturizers form a waterproof layer over the skin that reduces moisture and allows the body’s natural rehydration process to return the layer to a normal level."},{title:"An Overview Of Cosmetic Procedures",body:"Cosmetic surgery this and cosmetic surgery that. To truly understand cosmetic surgery, one needs to get a grasp of the various cosmetic surgery procedures available. An Overview of Cosmetic Procedures\n\nCosmetic surgery is one of the most talked about topics in the media today. People from all walks of life –  from celebrities to soccer moms – are going under the knife to have their faces and bodies modified. If you’re considering having a surgical cosmetic procedure performed, you might be wondering what cosmetic surgery procedures are available to make yourself look and feel better. Well, the technology of body modifying surgery has been steadily evolving over the last 50 years, and now there are more cosmetic surgery procedures available than ever.\n\nOne of the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures that is performed on a regular basis is liposuction. Liposuction is the process of removing excess fat deposits under the skin by using a vacuum. A small incision is made in the skin of the area that you wish to remove fat from, and then a thin tube called a cannula is inserted. In order to aid the suction, fluid may be pumped under the skin that includes an anesthetic. Another option is to use an ultrasound probe to break up the fat deposits. The liquefied fat is then suctioned through the cannula. Since there is only a small cut made in the skin, recovery is relatively easy, and the procedure usually leaves only tiny scars or no scars at all.\n\nAnother cosmetic surgery that is performed routinely is a rhinoplasty. Rhinoplasty comes from the Greek words for “nose” and “to shape” and it is the medical term for a nose job. In rhinoplasty, surgeons reshape the nose by removing and transforming the cartilage in the nose, as well as changing the shape of the skin around the nostrils and smoothing out the tip of the nose. Surgeons can perform these types of cosmetic surgery procedures with only a small incision at the base of the nose, or some will do a “closed” procedure where there is no incision required. Nose jobs have become commonplace among many different age groups and social groups, and many people elect to have this surgery to correct bumps and crooked appearance of the nose that was either present at birth or caused by an accident.\n\nA third popular procedure is one that most people think of when cosmetic surgery procedures are mentioned. Breast enhancement surgery is very popular and one of the most performed procedures. The use of silicone implants, however, has been banned for some time. Enhancements are now done with saline solution implants or some derivative. With improvements in technology, however, silicone implants are about to become available again. There are many more cosmetic surgery procedures available for those who wish to modify different parts of their body and face, such as face lifts, tummy tucks, and even buttocks implants. Cosmetic surgeons today specialize in helping to create a new look for patients who have small imperfections or large amounts of correction needed – and the field is still evolving."},{title:"Curling Irons Are As Individual As The Women Who Use Them",body:"When it comes to looking your best, there are some standard tools of the trade. You will want to find the right makeup for your complexion. You’ll want to find the best clothes and the right hair stylist. You’ll also want to be sure that you have the right products for styling your hair – shampoo and conditioner, gels or mousse or other products, a great blow dryer and, of course, the right curling iron.\n\nSome people seem to think that curling irons are all the same. They don’t understand that the inexpensive curling irons like the ones that can be bought in discount stores aren’t built to last the same way that curling irons from a beauty supply store are. They don’t understand that, even when it comes to curling irons from a beauty supply store, there can be big differences between one curling iron and the next.\n\nSome curling irons work in a way that is similar to a styling brush and a hair dryer – using hot air to style your hair. Some are made with narrow wands for tighter curls; others are made with a wider wand meant to provide long flowing waves in your hair. You can find a curling iron to create spiral curls, spring curls and even curling irons that don’t really do much curling per se — curling irons that are used to straighten hair.\n\nHowever, even once you’ve found the right curling iron to keep up your hair style, you may be confused about which type of curling iron is best for your hair. In addition to the hot air curling brush, you’ll find that there are a number of other options: ceramic, steam, metal. There are traditional curling irons that you’ll plug into the wall, and then there are butane curling irons and propane fueled curling irons that you’ll be able to use anywhere.\n\nButane and propane fueled curling irons are a great asset for getting ready on the go. Running late to head to the office? Take your curling iron with you and squeeze in a few minutes in the restroom before you make it to your desk. Going out after work? Take your butane curling iron with you to the office, heat it up, style your hair before you leave the office and you won’t have to make a trip back home.\n\nMore importantly, though, if you do much traveling, you’ll find that a butane or propane fueled curling iron is an ideal option. Why is a gas-powered iron such a great choice? There are three reasons that rise above the rest:\n\n1. Once you’re accustomed to using a butane curling iron, you won’t want to switch back to another style.\n\n2. Propane fueled curling irons can easily be taken with you wherever you go. Not only is it easy to take one along with you to the office, but it is easy to slip one into your carry-on bag or suitcase when you travel.\n\n3. When you travel with a butane curling iron or propane fueled curling iron, you won’t have to worry about finding the right adapter when you travel out of the United States, because you don’t have to plug in your curling iron.\n\nStill not sure that this style of curling iron is right for you – or, for that matter, right for travel? Try talking over the choice with your stylist or with others who use them. You are bound to hear stories about how convenient it is to not have to worry about remembering to unplug your curling iron before you leave home. Similarly, you won’t have to worry about tripping over the cord, having someone else trip over the cord or having the family pet decide that chewing on the electrical cord is a good idea.\n\nAfter all, your curling iron should be an asset, not a liability. Your curling iron – once you find the one that is right for your hair and hair style – should also be something that you don’t need to replace on a fairly regular basis. Therefore, it makes sense to consider more than just “any” curling iron; consider finding a curling iron that will meet your needs wherever you are – whether you’re traveling across town or traveling around the world."},{title:"10 Easy Steps To Clearer Skin",body:"At some stage in all our lives we want clearer, fresher, younger looking skin. Well it can be achieved without spending a lot of money and it can happen naturally! What you must do is persevere and over the course of three weeks your skin will begin to look fresher and clearer.

After cleansing the skin pat dry and then spray a fine toning mist over the face to cool and help close the pores while they are clean. Let this mist dry on the face.\n\n3. When the toner has dried apply a very small amount of moisturizer over the entire face and neck. Look for a moisturizer that is made for problem skin types and contains antibacterial ingredients like tea tree oil and lavender essential oil. These ingredients are gentle but very effective at clearing the skin from blemishes and pimples.\n\n4. Getting the right amount of restful sleep your body needs nightly will reflect in the state of your skin. Seven hours is generally adequate.

Doing it the opposite direction will push the toxins back into your system. Use a very gentle facial scrub on your face and neck as these areas can be easily damaged.\n\n7. Try an Aspirin face mask! This mask is having fantastic results on those people with open pores, pimples and acne. Crush about 15 aspirin tablets to a powder mix to a paste with a little water, less than 1 teaspoon and then apply to a cleansed face. Leave for twenty minutes to work its way into the skin and then rinse off and apply a light moisturizer. Try this weekly, after a face scrub.\n\n8. Once a month use a home steam treatment to thoroughly draw out impurities from the face. Add boiling water to a basin or bowl and add two drops of tea tree oil. Place your face over this with a towel covering and gently let the steam open and cleanse the pores. Be careful not to let the steam burn your face. Finish with a tepid face wash.\n\n9. Get out into the fresh air and take a walk, swim in the sea, ride a bike and have fun! The exercise will boost your system and your skin will love it.\n\n10. Take a fish oil supplement daily. Cultures that eat a lot of fish have clearer skin and the fish oil helps eliminate toxins from the body and by now you know that is fantastic for your skin!\n\nThese ten easy tips will help you get that clear skin you so desperately want, remember to make the lifestyle changes you need to and enjoy the benefits that will come with it! A fresher, clearer more youthful looking complexion."},{title:"Free Beauty Samples What They Are And How To Find Them",body:"Free Beauty Samples: What They Are and How to Find Them\n\nHave you heard of free beauty samples before?

Then came the sundial and finally the clocks and watches.\n\nThe actual purpose of the watch as we all know is to tell us the time, date, month, and day. With the introduction of modern trends, it came to be known more for its ornamental value than anything else. The once steel watch was transformed to Gold, silver, platinum, and white gold. The plain Jane unisex watch did a makeover to look grand with the studding of precious gems that glitter and sparkle on the wrist of both genders. Time never felt or looked better. \n\nLike with everything else, watches have evolved with time. There are mechanical watches, battery, solar, and kinetic powered watches. Mobile watch, ie. the wristwatch was popularized and materials used for the straps are all metals, including materials like leather. Sapphire crystals are used in watches to improve the quality and durability. Electronic watches with quart movements are mainly used these days. They do not need batteries and get charged with movement of the wrist. A mechanical watch does need winding up but lasts longer.\n\nBefore the advent of the wristwatch, all mobile watches that could be carried around were pocket watches. They were attached to a chain or rope and were kept in the pocket. \n\nComing to the current trend, a watch can do more than tell time. Some watches have a GPS or MP3 player in them and some are in fact mini computers. They also calculate for us, we can take pictures, and watch movies. Stopwatches are used for sports and they tell us the time down to the tenth of a second. Watches with heart rate monitors are exercise watches that will monitor and let us know the heart rate while we exercise. Now, people also look at the style and design of the watch. There are specific watches made for different purposes. There are the diving watches and sports watches that are waterproof.  Watches talk of us and bring forth our personality. Choosing the right watch based on our need and requirement is important. For a collector of time pieces, he would be looking at the uniqueness of the metal or precious gems used or the intricacy of the design. Similarly, youngsters would look for watches that make a fashion statement with lots of new features. Antique time pieces are found in antique stores worldwide and are a collectors joy. It is important to buy them from well-known makers and reliable stores, especially if one is looking for a very expensive stone studded one. For the regular watch, they are found everywhere these days, on the streets, small stores, exhibitions, or malls. Brand is the main thing people look for while buying a watch as a fashion accessory. Cartier, Rolex, Seiko, Omega, Swatch. Casio, Tag Heuer are a few of the top watch brands that are famous for their quality, look, and design. Some of them stock jeweled watches studded with precious gems like diamonds and other gems, that gives the watch an unusual and elegant look. They have thousands of varieties in men’s and women’s watches. This beautiful time piece given as a gift is timeless and can be gifted to anyone close to us."},{title:"Wedding Rings A Gift For A Lifetime",body:"‘With this ring, I thee wed’. The most beautiful words ever spoken. The words that bring a man and woman together in a bond of eternity. This is done by slipping a ring on the bride’s and groom’s fingers by each other.  The wedding ring plays a most important role in bringing two hearts together in love for a lifetime. \n\nThere is no wonder that wedding rings are chosen with extreme care, because they are for a lifetime. Men’s wedding rings are usually made in plain metal and women’s wedding rings made with precious stones, like diamonds and other gemstones. These days, of course, even men prefer wearing rings set with precious stones. There are gold wedding rings, white gold wedding rings, platinum wedding rings, and many more.\n\nWedding rings come in different styles, like the plain ones and ones that are engraved. The wedding rings should match the personality of the bride and groom. There are wedding ring sets available for the couple, that are made with the same metal and set with the same precious stones. This makes it all the more exciting actually. Imagine both of you wearing similarly styled rings. I am sure that gives a nice feeling of being part of each other of being one. \n\nThe wedding ring is a symbolism for love that has no end and goes in circles. Did you know that in certain communities, it is considered bad luck to buy the wedding rings along with the engagement rings.  The wedding ring is worn on the ring finger. The hand on which it is worn depends on the tradition of each country. In the Western World, it is worn on the left hand and in some other countries, on the right hand.  The reason why it is worn on the ring finger is because in ancient times, the ring finger was considered to be the love finger and that is how this tradition of wearing the ring on this finger came into being. There is a custom in Europe to engrave the spouse’s name and wedding date inside the wedding ring. Depending on the culture, it is either the ring bearer, who is usually a small kid bringing the rings on a pillow, or the best man that is in charge of the wedding rings and he presents them at the time they are needed. \n\nIf you are making arrangements for your wedding day and buying wedding rings, it would be nice to keep in mind the traditions and meanings of the wedding rings. Although many people are opting not to follow a traditional wedding, it makes it more fun to include some of these traditions and make it a memorable day for you, with memories flashing in front of your eyes for years to come, whenever you look at your wedding rings. Let your wedding ring tell a tale of love."},{title:"Sleek Hair Sedu Style",body:"We’ve come a long way since our mothers straightened our hair with an iron and ironing board, and it has never been more evident than now. The Sedu hair straightener has revolutionized the way we straighten our hair and has proved that hair Sedu style is hair to be truly envious of.\n\nHair Sedu style is identified by sleek, straight, shiny and conditioned tresses, the likes of which can only be obtained by using the Sedu ceramic flat iron.

While it is certainly nice that it keeps us rooted to the planet, it also has a habit of pulling things lower than we might like over time. Breast Lifts – Improvement Without Implants\n\nCosmetic breast surgery is one of the more popular areas of plastic surgery. That being said, the controversy surrounding breast implants may make you pause when considering the various enhancement procedures available. Breast lifts are designed to fight the effects of gravity. The goal of the procedure is to raise and/or reshape sagging breasts. When breast lifts are discussed, most people assume the procedure necessarily includes the use of implants. While it is true that implants can be used in the process, it is equally true that they need not be. Obviously, the choice comes down to the final result you hope to achieve and the advice of your physician. Regardless, it is important to understand that you should not assume a lift requires implants. Breast lifts without implants can make a major difference in your appearance. One has to be a bit careful discussing the procedure because it tends to be tailored to the specific situation of each patient. That being said, the process typically involves the removal of excess skin combined with the repositioning of the remaining tissues. In one sense, breast lift surgery is very much an artistic endeavor. The plastic surgeon is essentially acting as a sculptor. As such, you absolutely must make sure you are comfortable with their style and past creations. The best way to do this is to sit down with the surgeon and review before and after pictures from past procedures. This is your body, so do not hesitate to express your opinions and ask questions. The surgeon will not be insulted. To the contrary, he or she would rather have as detailed an understanding as possible of your goal. He or she can then give you an idea of potential, reasonable results. As Einstein told us, gravity is one of the key forces in the universe. A breast lift can give you the ability to counter that force without dealing with the controversy surrounding implants."},{title:"Lasik Eye Surgery Are You Ready",body:"Is Lasik in your future?\n\nMillions of Americans turn to Lasik Surgery when their vision is less than perfect and they’re tired of being tied down to wearing glasses or contacts.

The cornea is a part of your eye that works to focus light and projects an image on the retina. This focusing of light is called refraction.

Platinum was steadily becoming more fashionable, but because of its rarity many could not afford it. Then, during World War II the government put a ban on the use of Platinum for any non-military functions and the demand for White Gold skyrocketed.\n\nThe most common alloys added to gold to produce white gold are nickel, palladium and silver. Most white gold jewelry is also given an electroplated rhodium coating to intensify brightness. Throughout this process, white gold retains many of the benefits of gold. It won’t tarnish and due to the metals added, it is stronger than its yellow counterpart.\n\nRecently, palladium has replaced nickel as the common alloy in white gold. It seems that a small percent of the population-approximately 12-15%-has an allergic reaction to nickel causing skin irritation and rashes. It is now required by law that jewelry pieces containing nickel be labeled “nickel-containing.”\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_gold\n\nhttp://www.gold.org/jewellery/technology/colours/white.html\n\nhttp://www.govmint.com/knowledgebase/PreciousMetals.aspx"},{title:"The 6 Step Non Surgical Facial Rejuvenation Program",body:"There is an anti-aging revolution occurring in healthcare today and that you are the main beneficiary. Nowhere in the field of anti-aging medicine are the breakthroughs and technological advances more exciting, more relevant and more readily available for immediate application and benefit to you than in the field of facial rejuvenation. Better, the most exciting, effective new discoveries are non-surgical methods for facial rejuvenation. Yes I said non-surgical and I said effective.\n\nHow do we change from that radiant 16 year old with smooth glowing fresh skin to the 40 something who is beginning to see her mother looking back at her in the mirror to the 65 year old with hooded eyes, puffy lower eyelids, jowls, and loose skin folds hanging under the chin. Let’s review and clearly understand what these changes are that we must look for, recognize and then take steps to correct.\n\nSkin Texture Changes (Surface Irregularities)\n\nThe aged facial skin looks dry when compared to a child’s skin. Over half of the crucial natural skin moisturizing agent Hyaluronic Acid is lost by the time we turn 50 and you cannot replace HA by taking a pill or applying it to your skin. Loss of hormonal support during menopause accelerates this change. Dry aged skin loses its glow, looks dull, almost grey. The aged skin is wrinkled and rough and pore size is enlarged. Uneven pigmentation, brown spots, and red spots (Pigment and Blood vessels)\n\nUneven pigmentation and over growth of blood vessels are characteristic of aged facial skin. These blemishes are a protective and inflammatory response of the skin to years of exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun and injury from free radicals released by harmful agents in our environment and diet.\n\nFine Lines and Wrinkles\n\nFine lines and wrinkles are classic signs of facial aging. Static wrinkles are those that are present in the skin when the face is at rest. These wrinkles are caused by the loss of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin. Collagen is destroyed by UV light from the sun and free radicals from other sources. As the collagen disappears volume is lost beneath the skin and the skin wrinkles. This is not unlike the way a grape wrinkles after drying to produce a raisin.\n\nDynamic wrinkles are those that you see when the face is moving- frown lines, laugh lines, worry lines, and crow’s feet. These lines are actually caused by the pull of the facial muscles beneath the facial skin. Dynamic wrinkles can become static wrinkles after years of repeated pulling by the facial muscles.\n\nDeep Facial Lines\n\nDeep facial lines are those lines around the mouth called the Nasal-labial fold line and the Marionette lines. These lines are different from wrinkles in that they are caused by a combination of the pull of the facial muscles and loose sagging skin. As the face ages, the skin becomes loose and falls over the line created by the facial muscle pull, for example the smile line.\n\nLoose skin\n\nThe skin of the aged face has lost it’s elasticity and has become loose. The cheek has fallen and created loose skin on the jaw called jowls. The skin beneath the jaw on the neck is also hanging down, a phenomenon called the turkey wattle.\n\nWhat Is Facial Rejuvenation\n\nThe definition of rejuvenate is to make young or youthful again or restore to an original or new state. True facial rejuvenation requires correction of all of the above facial aging changes for the face to be made young or youthful or restored to an original state. The 6-step program mis designed to address all aging changes without surgery.\n\nThe 6-Step Non-Surgical Facial Rejuvenation Program\n\nThe 6-step facial rejuvenation program consists of the following 6 steps:\n\n1. Exfoliation\n\n2. Stimulation of new collagen formation\n\n3. Removal of abnormal pigment and blood vessels\n\n4. Relaxation of lines of facial expression\n\n5. Fill deep facial lines 6. Skin tightening\n\nThe 6-Step Program In Action- How it’s Done\n\nStep 1-Exfoliation\n\nI start all of my patients on an exfoliation routine consisting of topical exfoliating creams and microdermabrasion or superficial chemical peels with glycolic or salicylic acid. The latter peels are no down time procedures, you leave the office a little pink but with a refreshed glow.

In fact, so popular has cosmetic surgery become that it is hard to turn on the television or open a magazine without encountering stories of lives transformed as a result of work being done. Vastly improved treatments and increased social acceptance has lead to cosmetic surgery becoming a normalised practice, as viable and realistic to the housewife as it is to the Hollywood star. None of which is surprising, considering the very real and immediate benefits cosmetic surgery can bring to the patient’s appearance and self-esteem.\n\nHowever, cosmetic surgery can still be beyond the budget of many, which is why there is a growing trend for people to travel to parts of the world where the standard of expertise and post-operation care is just as good as in the United Kingdom, but up to sixty percent cheaper. Such savings are made due to favorable exchange rates This is particularly significant when you consider that medical health insurance doesn’t cover the cost of elective cosmetic surgery. So now patients are choosing to enjoy holidays to exotic destinations such as Malaysia and Thailand in addition to improving their appearance. No country is more suited to this combination than Brazil, land of sun and sea and the body beautiful, and second only to the United States in terms of the number of surgical operations performed every year. The 3500 plus members of the Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery are renowned for their experience and expertise, which makes sense when you consider that 80% of all plastic surgery in the United Kingdom is reconstructive, whereas 80% of all plastic surgery in Brazil is cosmetic, and that cosmetic surgery magazines clutter up the shelves in newsagents the same way that computer and golf magazines do here. The level of service in the Brazilian private health sector is extremely high, to mention all of those wonderful beaches you can strut your stuff down after you’ve made a full recovery!\n\nOf course, another benefit of having cosmetic surgery abroad is that it guarantees total privacy, so that you won’t need to worry about friends, neighbours and work colleagues seeing you in the immediate aftermath of the operation. You can recover in a relaxed environment, choose who you want to see and have all manner of complementary therapies and additional work done while you’re at it. In order to make the most of your stay in the country and feel confident you’ve hired a surgeon with the sufficient level of expertise to carry out the work, it is advisable to engage the services of a cosmetic surgery company who regularly deals with sending clients from the United Kingdom to Brazil, or your country of choice. This will also insure that you are given the appropriate level of follow-up care, including careful monitoring in the days immediately following surgery. Not only will this give you piece of mind, but it will save you money as the company uses contacts that have been built up in the country over a number of years.\n\nRegardless of this, it is worth understanding that all types of surgery carry a degree of risk and that surgical results differ from person to person and depend on many factors, including the patient’s age, medical history and health, and that results may be slightly different from those that you were expecting. As such, it is a good indication of the responsibility and professionalism of the surgeon that such things are discussed in detail before any operation takes place and you are aware of any complications or side effects that may occur, no matter how rare.

In India, a lady always covers her shoulders, because they are her most private and erogenous feature. In Senegal, a woman’s legs are her most erotic feature.

This can be very frustrating, particularly because the mold of the breasts can be obstinate to alter. If a lady is forlorn with her legs, she can effect and change her diet. If she is forlorn with her breasts however, she may feel that her options for altering them are out of her control.\n\nWhen people think of breast enhancement today, they think of surgery.

If a brackish works bursts or leaks, the brackish water will be absorbed into the body lacking great harm.\n\nImplants can be inserted one of four different ways. They can be inserted through incisions in the creases underneath the breasts. They can be inserted through the skin in an notch made around the nipple. The third choice is for the physician to make an notch near the armpits, and introduce the implants through that area. The fourth, newest and most expensive choice is endoscopic surgery, in which an endoscope, or tiny camera, enables the physician to introduce the implants through a tiny notch in the woman’s abdomen button. That a woman’s breast implants can now be inserted through her navel is amazing, but true.\n\nDespite the prevalence of surgery as a means for breast enlargement, there is no denying that the fallout are regularly flawed. Not only do implants frequently leak, necessitating a instant surgery, but they regularly just don’t look very good. Capsular contracture frequently sets in, squeezing the works and resultant in a hard, fake-looking breast.\n\nMore and more women are discovering what their ancestors knew hundreds and even thousands of existence ago: herbs can be worn to enhance breast health, density and size. Today’s breast enhancement pills use sound science, along with some ancient ingredients, to help enlarge women’s breasts naturally, lacking side effects. They are significantly minus expensive than surgery, as well, which is an added bonus.\n\nThese pills are commonly made of non-hormonal works estrogen, or phytoestrogen. The phytoestrogen activates the prostaglandins in the woman’s breasts. Prostaglandins, first discovered in the 1930s by Swedish scientist Ulf von Euler, control and communicate with glands.

There are several significant benefits to wearing sunglasses every time you go out into sunlight.\n\nDRIVING GLARE\n\nSunglasses with 100% UV tinting cut down on glare from reflected sunlight. This reduces squinting (and the wrinkles it causes), and can prevent certain migraines and headaches brought on by bright light. But the real benefit comes when you’re driving: glare from a road can temporarily blind drivers. UV tinted sunglasses allow you to avoid this potential hazard. And you don’t have to choose dark lenses: pale amber or other light colors work just as well to prevent glare, as long as they are 100% UV tinted.\n\nBLOW DRYING YOUR EYES\n\nWind and air conditioning can dry out your eyes, causing discomfort, redness, itchiness and soreness. In cars, air conditioning often feels best when it’s blowing near your face – and that means into your eyes. Wearing sunglasses – even when it’s not sunny – cuts down on the effects of air blowing directly into your eyes. Don’t forget cataracts – one of those ailments you don’t really think about until it’s too late. Long term excessive exposure to UV rays can cause cataracts in your eyes. Symptoms include blurred vision, light sensitivity, double vision, needing brighter light to read, and fading of colors. Wearing sunglasses regularly can prevent or slow the development of cataracts, so it’s never too early to start."}]},function(e,t){e.exports=[{title:"Upgrading To Microsoft Windows Vista Tips",body:"Upgrading To Microsoft Windows Vista Tips\n\nThe traditional annual days of giving are at hand.

Once the bill was passed and signed into law by the president, it became much harder to reverse the law. The democrats would need to bring up the law and get it to a vote, then after the vote passed it needs to go to the president for his signature. The problem with this is that the current president is the one who signed the bill into law in the first place.\n\nAnother problem is because the gambling ban was attached to another bill, it means that to reverse the law the entire bill needs to be reversed, but the other part of the bill is for an increase in port security, so any congressmen who recommends reversing this law, will be going on record as trying to reverse the increase in port security.\n\nBecause of this trying to get the law reversed could ruin a congressman’s chances of ever getting elected to public office again for the rest of their lives.\n\nIt is more likely that it will have to wait till the end of George Bushes term in office and then get an amendment to the law that reverses only gambling ban part of the law.\n\nSo if you are on Online Gambling enthusiast and you were hoping that after the election the online gambling ban would just disappear I am sorry to say you were mistaken and that you are going to have to wait a little longer, but that does not mean you need to sit quietly by.\n\nThe key is to make sure that you are heard, write letters to congressmen, and attend protest rallies anything that will keep this issue in the front of the minds of the politicians so they know that just as the Republicans lost the house so can they.\n\nThe republicans used the online gambling ban to try to gain votes for them in the last weeks before the election, but it backfired on them and lost them more votes then it brought in.\n\nHopefully the Democrats will learn from the mistakes of the Republicans and will understand that banning something never works, and that it is only thru regulating the online gambling industry that will ensure that it is safe and honest to play and that no underage children manage to play.\n\nOther wise I am sure that the Democrats will also see the wrath of the American voters when it comes time for the next elections.\n\nThe American people are tired of having the government controlling every aspect of their lives and I think this election may have made their point for them.\n\nSo if the question is will they try to reverse the law I am sure they will try, but how successful they will be is still up in the air, and no one can really know what the outcome will be."},{title:"Anonymous Proxy",body:"How to Surf the Web Anonymously — Part 1\n\nSo you’re trying to surf a site like myspace, hotmail or yahoo mail from work or school and its blocked by your school, work or government.

A proxy is another computer that is like a mask your computer puts on when it connects to the Internet. It’s also a private gateway to blocked sites because the site you are actually surfing is hidden behind the proxy, which is unblocked.

Sony is a name that over time has established itself as creating a solid product with a stellar reputation. In addition to all the good press that Sony has, Sony is known for making the best ‘small’ laptops. This means that they pack a ton of features into a much smaller packet and do it better than most laptop companies around. If you are in the market for a laptop it makes perfect sense to look around, compare your options and decide on the laptop that will ultimately work best for you. There are many companies out there that offer similar products; some are superior, some inferior, some at a premium price, and still others at bargain prices. The laptop industry isn’t always an industry where you get what you pay for.\n\nWhen choosing a laptop, it is never a good idea to buy what others think you should buy, buy the laptop that has the features that you need at a price that you can afford. Don’t buy a laptop that has bells and whistles you will never utilize. Perhaps, that is what I like most about Sony and the products they offer. Sony Laptops aren’t about stuffing computers full of features that will never be useful to the average consumer. Instead, they build a computer that the average consumer can use and offer upgrades beyond their basic computer setup. When you buy a Sony laptop you are not only buying a great laptop, you are buying a solid name from a company that over time has proven it will stand behind its products and services. Sony products have been around for years and the company is on solid ground, they will be around for years to come. Their laptops are made with the same attention to detail and technological evolution that has made Sony famous, that being said, it’s a fair assessment that a Sony laptop is a good investment as far as laptops go."},{title:"Where Can You Find Unique Myspace Layouts Nowadays",body:"With MySpace becoming more popular every day, there is the constant need to be different. There are millions of users, and there will be many who might even use the same layouts. If MySpace layouts are chosen well, then you can enhance your profile a great deal. This will help you get more contacts as well. But because of the demand, there will be the need to find unique layouts.\n\nSo many users are quite confused about where they may find the right layouts.

Email, instant messaging and file sharing with other Internet users has also provided a platform for faster spreading of viruses, Trojans and Spyware. Being on the Internet without proper protection is like walking in the rain with no umbrella – you’re gonna get wet no matter how fast you run. With so many computers installed in home offices it becomes critical that home users install the latest Microsoft patches when they become available. Older operating systems like Windows 98, Windows Millennium, Windows 2000, or Windows XP prior to Service Pack require the user to initiate the process of checking for security patches. Windows XP Service Pack 2 has changed this and the default settings are now notifying the user of available updates automatically. This has increased the level of security in some areas, but there is a very large number of users and computers that do not install security patches or hot fixes provided by Microsoft. \n\nOnce patches are available Microsoft recommends to install them immediately. Depending on the confidence level of the user this should be done fairly soon after the patch release. If a users has several systems available it is recommended to test the patches on the least critical system first before updating all machines. Only one machine at a time is recommended to keep track of things and to be able to fix problems. In Windows XP it is also recommended to create a restore point first so that the system can revert back to the existing state before patching. Home users should closely follow the media about virus outbreaks and updates. Waiting a few days with patching a machine can make sense if some critical work is done on the computer an important deadline needs to be kept. Nothing is more annoying than having to fight computer problems with limited time at hand. Speaking of time – never install patches without having enough time at hand. Users should allocate 60 minutes of time just in case. If something goes wrong time pressure is the last thing you want to face when troubleshooting a machine that is down."

For approximately $700.00, consumers could purchase one of top-of-the-line Pocket PCs in 2003.

While men’s borderline-inappropriate behavior is often laughed off as “boys will be boys,” women face higher conduct standards – especially in the workplace. That’s why it’s crucial that, as women, our behavior on the job is beyond reproach.\n\nSmall Towns and Big States\n\nFor evidence of the double standard, we need look no farther than Arlington, Oregon, where Mayor Carmen Kontur-Gronquist was recalled in a 142-139 vote after the town’s denizens discovered that the mayor’s MySpace page featured photos of her in lingerie. Although Kontur-Gronquist is alleging election fraud and challenging the returns, and even though the mayoral position was unpaid, no one is arguing that her MySpace page did her in. Contrast her situation with that of David Paterson, New York’s new governor. After Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned amid allegations of engaging the services of a prostitute, Paterson was sworn in and admitted that he had engaged in extramarital affairs and that he had experimented with both cocaine and marijuana while he was in his twenties. It seems odd that the mayor of a small town in Oregon is being held to a higher standard than the governor of New York. With Computers, Private Can Go Public\n\nThe moral (so to speak) of the story is that, as women, our behavior must be impeccable – both on and off the job. Yes, we can have private lives, but we unwittingly make those private lives public when we boot up a computer, use email, or go online. To protect yourself in the workplace, the first rule of thumb is never to conduct personal business using your employer’s equipment. You have no right to privacy, and your employer can have total access to your record of computer usage, your Internet history, and your email. Resist the temptation to shop online, check the news, or surf the Internet while you’re at work. Don’t forward that joke or motivational email to your colleagues. And don’t email your friends or family members. The second thing to keep in mind is that the niche of the Internet you’ve carved out for yourself using your home computer is also visible to your employer. Increasingly, potential employers use tools to screen job candidates’ presence on the Internet. That hysterical YouTube video of you dancing with a lampshade on your head at your best friend’s bridal shower may prevent you from landing the job of your dreams. Before making a bold rant on your blog or uploading a questionable picture to a social networking site, think about the impact it might have on your career. There’s no arguing that computers enrich our lives and provide us with options our mothers never dreamed of. As women, though, computers can also be our downfall at work. It may be acceptable for men to check out the Sports Illustrated website while they’re at work (even the swimsuit edition!), but women are held to a higher standard… Just ask Carmen Kontur-Gronquist."},{title:"3 Simple Ways To Save A Bunch Of Money When Buying A New Computer",body:"Looking to buy a new computer?\n\nOverwhelmed by all of the options available to you? Stressed by the high cost of computers today?\n\nFor most people, buying a new computer does not have to be as stressful as buying a new car. Nor does it have to be as expensive. If you’re like most people, and you have a limited budget for buying a computer, then you need to try to get as much computer for your money as possible.\n\nHere are 3 simple ways anyone can save money when buying a new computer:\n\n1) Shop around for best deal.\n\nSounds pretty obvious. But many people don’t realize they don’t need the fastest, most expensive computer with the most “extras”. In fact, if you are already using an older computer, even the least expensive new computer will be a big upgrade. If you don’t know a lot about computers, you can learn a lot by shopping around. Ask lots of questions, compare prices, compare features, then find the best price. Shop at your local electronics store, and look for the best deals online. You’ll be surprised at how much money you can save by shopping around!\n\n2) Install your own “extras”\n\nMany computers you will find in a store have a lot of extra software already installed. While this is convenient, it is not always the best way for you to save money. Also, while many of these extras sound good, you don’t always need them. You can often find better deals by shopping around separately for your own software extras (such as a word processor, anti-virus, popup blocker, spyware removal, games, etc). And some of these you can get for free. So before you buy the “fully loaded” computer, ask yourself if you really need all the extras, then shop around to see if you can buy a scaled down computer – and get the extras yourself for much less!\n\n3) Don’t buy extended warranty\n\nIf you are not a computer “techie”, the extended warranties offered by the computer retailers often sound like a good idea. After all, who wants to be bothered paying for service on a computer after you buy it. But keep in mind that most computers come with a warranty, and most computer problems will either happen at the beginning (when you still have the warranty in effect) or much later (when it might be cheaper to buy a new computer). Technology changes very quickly these days. So consider whether or not it’s worth the inflated price of the extended warranty. And, if you really feel you need the extended warranty, then ask to purchase it at a lower price. Not all retailers will negotiate on the warranty, but some will. And whether you buy the extended warranty or not, make sure you back up all your files periodically, just in case!\n\nIf you have an unlimited budget, consider yourself lucky. And if you do business on the computer, make sure you get what you need, while trying to keep the price down. At any price, buying something that does not fit your needs is not a good deal.\n\nHope you find these tips helpful, and happy computer shopping!"},{title:"Myspace Layouts The Missing Element",body:"The world has become so fast paced that people don’t want to stand by reading a page of information, they would much rather look at a presentation and understand the message.

As the descriptive name implies, HDCP is all about protecting the integrity of various audio and video content as it travels over a multiplicity of different types of interfaces. Such data interfaces as GVIF, DVI, and HDMI will all support the functionality of HDCP. \n\nIs HDCP Free?\n\nNo. HDCP requires an authorized license. The license can be obtained through Digital Content Protection, which is a subsidiary of Intel Corporation. Generally, the license can be obtained by filing an application and paying an annual fee. Once the application is accepted and the user agrees to the terms found in the licensing agreement, the right to make use of HDCP is granted. \n\nWhat Are Some Of The Key Terms of Use For HDCP?\n\nOne key term has to do with the transmission of data to unauthorized receivers. That is, an HDCP protected video source is not allowed to transmit protected content to any receiver that has not be verified to be HDCP compliant. There is also a restriction on the quality of the content, making sure that the DVD-audio content is equal to or less than CD-audio quality on any non-HDCP digital audio outputs. The licensed operator also covenants to not use their equipment to produce copies of content, and also to make sure that original content is created within the confines of current content protection requirements. What Type of Devices Make Use of HDCP?\n\nThere are a number of different devices that make use of HDCP. DVD players are a common example, including systems that support high-definition DVD components. Blu-Ray discs are another example. Generally, it is possible for the manufacturer of the device to set what is known as an Image Constraint Token that will structure the type of output signal that can be read and translated. How Widespread Is The Use of HDCP?\n\nSince 2004, HDCP has been widely used in the United States. Elsewhere, HDCP has also gained a firm hold. The European Industry Association for Information Systems has deemed HDCP as a required component on all HD ready European devices. The latest Microsoft operating system, Windows Vista, makes use of HDCP as part of the function of graphics cards and monitors."},{title:"Baby Monitor Technology",body:"Having a baby can be a nerve wracking experience for new parents – not the nine months of pregnancy, I’m talking about after the infant is brought home from the hospital. It’s always the same thing, by the time they have their third child they have it all figured out, but with number one it’s a learning thing.\n\nBaby monitors help you hear your baby’s needs without you having to be in the room with the baby. Some baby monitors are portable, or “mobile” and are small enough that you can carry it in your pocket as you do your daily chores around the house. Depending on your price range it’s best to have a base unit that plugs into the wall. The receiving unit can be like your portable phone, you can carry it around with you, and plug it back into the base unit to be recharged.\n\nSome people find that their baby monitor can be interrupted by cell phones, mobile phones, computer networks and even your neighbors baby monitors. Be aware of any potential interruptions before you put the monitor into official use. Also, make sure you get a monitor with a receiving unit that emits a tone when the battery is going low so you won’t be caught with a dead battery.\n\nAnother consideration before purchasing a baby monitor is the range the monitors have. If you have a more regular sized home say 1,800 you probably won’t have any problem with a conventional baby monitor. If you live in a home that has square footage of 4,000 or more, or if you live in a multi level home you may need a specific type of unit.\n\nThere are baby monitors available that actually feature what is called a “sensor pad”. The pad is placed underneath the crib sheet and picks up any movement the baby may make. Some physicians recommend these types of monitors for premature babies."},{title:"Life Advice Looking Through A Window",body:"Living in today’s metropolitan world of cellular phones, mobile computers and other high-tech gadgets is not just hectic but very impersonal. We make money and then invest our time and effort in making more money. Does it end? Not usually because we are never satisfied. How many times have we convinced ourselves that if only we had some more money, life would be so sweet? But then, after receiving a substantial raise, we realize that it wasn’t enough and that we need more?\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\nI have read many books on life such as Robin Sharma’s Monk says this and the monk says that, and they all seem to say that money is not necessary. But it is. Can you do without cash and a lot of it? I know I can’t. So, I went to the neighbourhood Rabbi and asked for advice that will help me find my true way in life. The rabbi nodded and took me to the window. “What do you see?” he asked me.\n\nPromptly, I answered, “I can see people walking to and fro and a blind man is begging for alms at the left corner.”\n\nThe Rabbi nodded and guided me to a big mirror. “Now look and tell me what you see?”\n\n“I can see myself,” I man answered.\n\nThe Rabbi smiled. “Now you can’t see anyone else. The mirror and the window are both created from the same raw material: glass, but because on one of them they have applied a thin layer of silver, when you look at it all you can see is your own reflection.”\n\nThe Rabbi placed his arm on my shoulders. “Compare yourself to those two pieces of glass. Without the silver layer, you saw the other people and felt compassion for them. When you are covered with silver, you see only yourself.”\n\nI looked at the Rabbi and stared. “I don’t understand.”\n\nThe Rabbi continued. “You will become someone only if have the courage to remove the silver covering over your eyes in order to again see and love others.” He patted me on my back and sent me on my way.\n\nI have thought of what he said and come to the conclusion that he had a point. Yes. We need money and we should not aim to lead a moneyless existence; its pointless and will only cause us and our families many heartbreaks in the future.\n\nInstead, I suggest that we should follow the advice the Rabbi gave me. When we approach life through a silver covering, all we are able to see is ourselves. But discard that covering, and you will be able to see and feel everyone else. \n\nIn life, we are allowed to and should be able to look at both kinds of mirrors, but we should remember that a mirror reflects only us; a window is the door to compassion, health and true wealth. In other words, seek wealth by all means, but don’t let it dissuade you from life, people, children and the poor and needy."},{title:"How To Protect Your Computer Wery Useful Tips",body:"Today, many people rely on computers to do homework, work, and create or store useful information. Therefore, it is important for the information on the computer to be stored and kept properly. It is also extremely important for people on computers to protect their computer from data loss, misuse, and abuse. For example, it is crucial for businesses to keep information they have secure so that hackers can’t access the information. Home users also need to take means to make sure that their credit card numbers are secure when they are participating in online transactions. A computer security risk is any action that could cause lost of information, software, data, processing incompatibilities, or cause damage to computer hardware,  a lot of these are planned to do damage. An intentional breach in computer security is known as a computer crime which is slightly different from a cypercrime. A cybercrime is known as illegal acts based on the internet and is one of the FBI’s top priorities. There are several distinct categories for people that cause cybercrimes, and they are refereed as hacker, cracker, cyberterrorist, cyberextortionist, unethical employee, script kiddie and corporate spy. The term hacker was actually known as a good word but now it has a very negative view. A hacker is defined as someone who accesses a computer or computer network unlawfully. They often claim that they do this to find leaks in the security of a network. The term cracker has never been associated with something positive this refers to someone how intentionally access a computer or computer network for evil reasons. It’s basically an evil hacker. They access it with the intent of destroying, or stealing information. Both crackers and hackers are very advanced with network skills. A cyberterrorist is someone who uses a computer network or the internet to destroy computers for political reasons. It’s just like a regular terrorist attack because it requires highly skilled individuals, millions of dollars to implement, and years of planning. The term cyperextortionist is someone who uses emails as an offensive force. They would usually send a company a very threatening email stating that they will release some confidential information, exploit a security leak, or launch an attack that will harm a company’s network. They will request a paid amount to not proceed sort of like black mailing in a since. An unethical employee is an employee that illegally accesses their company’s network for numerous reasons. One could be the money they can get from selling top secret information, or some may be bitter and want revenge. A script kiddie is someone who is like a cracker because they may have the intentions of doing harm, but they usually lack the technical skills. They are usually silly teenagers that use prewritten hacking and cracking programs. A corporate spy has extremely high computer and network skills and is hired to break into a specific computer or computer network to steal or delete data and information. Shady companies hire these type people in a practice known as corporate espionage. They do this to gain an advantage over their competition an illegal practice. Business and home users must do their best to protect or safeguard their computers from security risks. The next part of this article will give some pointers to help protect your computer. However, one must remember that there is no one hundred percent guarantee way to protect your computer so becoming more knowledgeable about them is a must during these days. When you transfer information over a network it has a high security risk compared to information transmitted in a business network because the administrators usually take some extreme measures to help protect against security risks. Over the internet there is no powerful administrator which makes the risk a lot higher. If your not sure if your computer is vulnerable to a computer risk than you can always use some-type of online security service which is a website that checks your computer for email and Internet vulnerabilities. The company will then give some pointers on how to correct these vulnerabilities. The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center is a place that can do this. The typical network attacks that puts computers at risk includes viruses, worms, spoofing, Trojan horses, and denial of service attacks. Every unprotected computer is vulnerable to a computer virus which is a potentially harming computer program that infects a computer negatively and altering the way the computer operates without the user’s consent. Once the virus is in the computer it can spread throughout infecting other files and potentially damaging the operating system itself. It’s similar to a bacteria virus that infects humans because it gets into the body through small openings and can spread to other parts of the body and can cause some damage. The similarity is, the best way to avoid is preparation. A computer worm is a program that repeatedly copies itself and is very similar to a computer virus. However the difference is that a virus needs o attach itself to an executable file and become a part of it. A computer worm doesn’t need to do that I seems copies to itself and to other networks and eats up a lot of bandwidth. A Trojan Horse named after the famous Greek myth and is used to describe a program that secretly hides and actually looks like a legitimate program but is a fake. A certain action usually triggers the Trojan horse, and unlike viruses and worms they don’t replicate itself. Computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses are all classifies as malicious-logic programs which are just programs that deliberately harms a computer. Although these are the common three there are many more variations and it would be almost impossible to list them. You know when a computer is infected by a virus, worm, or Trojan horse if one or more of these acts happen:\n\n?	Screen shots of weird messages or pictures appear.\n\n?	You have less available memory then you expected\n\n?	Music or sounds plays randomly.\n\n?	Files get corrupted\n\n?	Programs are files don’t work properly\n\n?	Unknown files or programs randomly appear\n\n?	System properties fluctuate\n\nComputer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses deliver their payload or instructions through four common ways. One, when an individual runs an infected program so if you download a lot of things you should always scan the files before executing, especially executable files. Second, is when an individual runs an infected program. Third, is when an individual bots a computer with an infected drive, so that’s why it’s important to not leave media files in your computer when you shut it down. Fourth is when it connects an unprotected computer to a network. Today, a very common way that people get a computer virus, worm, or Trojan horse is when they open up an infected file through an email attachment. There are literally thousands of computer malicious logic programs and new one comes out by the numbers so that’s why it’s important to keep up to date with new ones that come out each day. Many websites keep track of this. There is no known method for completely protecting a computer or computer network from computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, but people can take several precautions to significantly reduce their chances of being infected by one of those malicious programs. Whenever you start a computer you should have no removable media in he drives. This goes for CD, DVD, and floppy disks. When the computer starts up it tries to execute a bot sector on the drives and even if it’s unsuccessful any given various on the bot sector can infect the computer’s hard disk. If you must start the computer for a particular reason, such as the hard disk fails and you are trying to reformat the drive make sure that the disk is not infected."},{title:"5 Reasons To Purchase Desktop Computers",body:"If you are in the market for a computer, there are a number of factors to consider. Will it be used for your home, your office or perhaps even your home office combo? First off, you will need to set a budget for your new purchase before deciding whether to shop for notebook or desktop computers. Many offices use desktop computers because they are not intended to be moved around a lot. In addition, affordability often plays a large role in someone’s decision as to whether to purchase notebook or desktop computers.\n\nWhile you are shopping around, it’s important to keep in mind some of the benefits that go along with owning different types of computers. To that end, this article provides five important reasons to purchase desktop computers.\n\n– Desktop computers are typically much more affordable than notebook computers. With notebooks, you are paying more for the convenience of portability. For as little as $299.00, desktop computers can be purchased from one of the leading manufacturers and a notebook computer for as little as $499.00.\n\n– Unlike notebook computers, replacing a keyboard, mouse, speakers or even a monitor does not require having your computer serviced by a professional repair shop. Because notebook computers have everything built in, including the aforementioned features, it is more difficult to replace a keyboard or monitor as opposed to desktop computers, which operate on external connections.\n\n– In the event of an unlawful entry into your home, desktop computers are not as likely to be stolen because of their weight and bulk. Notebook computers, on the other hand, are small and portable. This, alone, makes them more appealing to a thief than desktop computers.\n\n– Desktop computers are stationary by nature. Unlike a notebook computer, which can easily be moved from room to room, they are less likely to be dropped or broken because they are not moved as often.\n\n– The vents on desktop computers are located on the back of the tower, which allows for proper ventilation that will help to prevent the computer from overheating. Notebook computers, on the other hand, feature only one vent on the back with the remaining underneath the base. If placed on a table, the air vents can become blocked and the computer may overheat. If prolonged use leads to overheating, damage may result.\n\nWhen choosing from the many desktop computers on the market, always make sure that you purchase from a manufacturer who has experience in creating computers. Even though they are more affordable than notebooks, desktop computers are not cheap. With an investment that involves several hundred dollars, you will want to consider the length of time the manufacturer has been in business, their reputation with customers and their warranty. \n\nAdditionally, when choosing any system, including desktop computers, always look at the potential for future upgrading. As you grow, you will want your computer to grow with you and a part of that will include a slight upgrade from time to time. This is the only way to get the best use of your desktop computers and make sure that your investment is one that lasts for years to come."

I want to look at the major and most effective ways to find information online.   The biggest and most commonly used method is to use a search engine such as : Google, Yahoo, or Msn. All three of these search engines offer similar features. Text search, Image search, Local search, Product search, are a few of the services they offer. It used to be only a few years ago where Google dominated the Search Engine market. Due largely to the fact that their search technology was the most advanced. Because of the huge investment other companies have put into their search technology, it’s getting harder and harder every day to say which one is really the best. With this in mind I think it comes down more now to which company do you prefer or which layout you like the most. Another method used to find information is through what is called a Web Directory. Web directories will usually either be relative or general:\n\nRelative – A relative web directory will contain information and links to websites that are all to do with one topic. An example would be a Weight Loss directory that contains only information and links to sites that have something to do with Weight Loss.\n\nGeneral – A general web directory is a site that will contain links and information to do with all types of categories. It will usually be arranged topically to allow ease of use in finding exactly what you want. The biggest and one of the most used directories is dmoz.org, which contains links and information to thousands of different sites, all arranged into categories.\n\nI would recommend checking out a few of these sites, and really trying them out for yourself to see which one will be suit your needs.

Starting initially in Europe, the craze spread globally shortly after. With FTA satellite TV being available in almost every country across the globe, FTA satellite is the wave of the TV future. \n\nFree to air satellite TV channels are free. You can connect your receiver up to multiple satellite dishes and point your dish at different satellites in space. There are thousands of 100% free satellites in space with limited channels per satellite. Some free to air channels include PBS, International channels, and locals. These companies broadcast their signal for free. The majority of people with FTA receivers don’t point their dishes at these satellites. Infact, people all over the world including North America are reprogramming their boxes so they can point their dishes at real satellite TV and watch channels for free.  This is actually where FTA keys come into play. In order to watch FTA satellite TV this way. You need to be constantly entering what are called FTA keys or Dish keys into your receiver so that your receiver can keep itself updated with the satellites in space. This enables you to watch TV.\n\nBecause the keys are constantly changing and always need to be entered manually each time a key change occurs, this presents a problem and inconvenience to the user. This is why people program files called autoroll bins on to their receivers. Autoroll files automatically roll the keys over to the new keys everytime they change. These are what people often refer to as FTA fixes. FTA fixes fix your receiver essentially by getting your channels to work with very little human interaction other than initially programming the new FTA file to your receiver a few times a year. FTA files don’t work forever, they also go down from time to time and the user will have to load the new autoroll bins. \n\nUsually people get their autoroll bin files from sources like FTA Support websites. FTA Support sites offer a complete support service to their members giving them all the software, files, keys, and online technical support they’ll ever need to keep themsselves always up and watching TV. FTA support sites usually include online support and troubleshooting via email and they usually have all the downloads and setup instructions you’ll ever need to get your receiver working all the time.\n\nFTA receivers are getting bigger and better offering new innovative and experimental ideas and technologies that keep them interesting all the time.

I want to look at the major and most effective ways to find information online.   The biggest and most commonly used method is to use a search engine such as : Google, Yahoo, or Msn. All three of these search engines offer similar features. Text search, Image search, Local search, Product search, are a few of the services they offer. It used to be only a few years ago where Google dominated the Search Engine market. Due largely to the fact that their search technology was the most advanced. Because of the huge investment other companies have put into their search technology, it’s getting harder and harder every day to say which one is really the best. With this in mind I think it comes down more now to which company do you prefer or which layout you like the most. Another method used to find information is through what is called a Web Directory. Web directories will usually either be relative or general:\n\nRelative – A relative web directory will contain information and links to websites that are all to do with one topic. An example would be a Weight Loss directory that contains only information and links to sites that have something to do with Weight Loss.\n\nGeneral – A general web directory is a site that will contain links and information to do with all types of categories. It will usually be arranged topically to allow ease of use in finding exactly what you want. The biggest and one of the most used directories is dmoz.org, which contains links and information to thousands of different sites, all arranged into categories.\n\nI would recommend checking out a few of these sites, and really trying them out for yourself to see which one will be suit your needs. I’ve found that each site can be used most effectively in different situations. Happy information finding!\n\nFeel free to reprint this article as long as you keep the following caption and author biography in tact with all hyperlinks."},{title:"Computer Hardware Desktops And Notebooks And Handhelds Oh My",body:"Computers have become ubiquitous in almost every facet of our lives. At work, desk jockeys spend hours in front of their desktops, while delivery people scan bar codes with handhelds and workers in the field stay in touch with the central office via their notebooks. At home, we rely on our desktops and notebooks to do our shopping, to entertain us, and to keep us abreast of world events. We may not see our email servers, but we count on them to deliver our email whenever and wherever we want it. Our PDAs keep track of our hectic schedules, our to-do lists, our contact lists, and even entertain us with games while we’re waiting for an appointment or to board a plane. Computer hardware weaves itself through the fabric of our lives.\n\nEven though computer hardware is central to almost everything we do, it’s easy to lag behind in the advances made in both hardware and software. Desktops that are four or five years old, for example, become obsolete. You may be able to upgrade operating systems or buy computer add-ons to extend the life of your desktop, but at some point the software, applets, and plug-ins you need to get the most out of your computer simply won’t support your old machine. If it’s time to get new computer hardware – whether desktops, notebooks, or PDAs – you’ll be amazed at the computing power and the crisp displays that are available, as well as the incredible low prices. Take some time to shop around, and you’ll soon discover that online computer hardware sources will save you money over traditional retail stores. When you think about it, it makes sense. According to logic, direct sales cut out the middleman and can pass along the savings to the consumer.\n\nIf you’re in the market for new desktops, notebooks, or PDAs, there are a myriad of choices. Here’s a rundown of some of the best systems available:\n\nDesktops: First, you need to decide – as the advertising campaign so cleverly drives home – if you’re a Mac or if you’re a PC. If you’re a Mac, the iMac Desktop with a 20-inch display can be found for just under $1,500. That includes a 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, a 250 GB hard drive, and a SuperDrive. If you’re a PC, the Hewlett-Packard Pavilion S7700N Slimline Desktop PC includes an AMD Athlon Processor 3800 Plus, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB hard drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, and Vista Premium – the new Microsoft operating system. Price? You can find it for a little over $600. Notebooks: If you love Macs, you’ll adore Apple’s PowerBook at just under $2,500. With a 15.2-inch screen at 1280 x 854 resolution and TFT widescreen display, the PowerBook gives you a lot of bang for your buck. It runs on a 1.67 GHz PowerPC G4 and 512 MB RAM, and has an 80 GB hard drive and a SuperDrive. In the PC universe, the Toshiba Satellite A135-S4427 is a perfect example of the computing power you can get at a very low price. The 15.4-inch widescreen notebook has an Intel Core Duo Processor T2250, 1 GB RAM, a 120 GB hard drive, a SuperMulti DVD drive, and Vista Premium – all for around $900. When it comes to computer hardware, it pays to shop online. Desktops, handhelds, PDAs, notebooks, servers, and even software can be found at incredibly low prices – so low that you’ll want to upgrade all of your computer hardware to the fastest, clearest, best systems available."},{title:"How To Excel In A Technical Job Interview",body:"Ah, the technical interview. Nothing like it. Not only does it cause anxiety, but it causes anxiety for several different reasons. \n\nHow many people will be asking questions? From experience I can tell you there’s nothing like walking into a room and seeing nine people on the other side of the table.   Second, what will you be asked? You’ll sometimes hear people say the questions they were asked in a technical interview were “easy”, which translated means “they asked me stuff I happened to know”.  Sometimes you’ll hear people say the questions were “hard”, which translated means “they asked me stuff I didn’t know”, or “they asked me about stuff I’ve never even heard of”. \n\nHaving been on both sides of the technical interview table, I’d like to share some tips for those being interviewed. In doing so, I’ll share some of the more memorable interviews I’ve been involved in. \n\nNo good interviewer expects you to know everything. The problem is, you’re not always going to be interviewed by someone who’s good at it.   Sometimes, the person who’s giving you a technical interview was asked to do it about ten minutes before you showed up.  Maybe they’ve never interviewed anyone before, or maybe they’re just in a bad mood.  I’ve heard of technical interviewers where the interviewer derided an answer, and that’s totally unprofessional. I’ve had many a job candidate give a bad answer to a question, and my only response was silence followed by moving on to the next question. If your interviewer mocks any of your answers, you didn’t want to work there anyway. \n\nNone of us know everything.  If you’re asked a question you just don’t know the answer to, don’t try to BS your way past it.  This is a good opportunity to tell the interviewer how you would research that particular question. It’s not about knowing everything, it’s about being able to find out anything.  \n\nIf your interviewer acts like he/she already dislikes you, that’s because they do.  I once worked with a technician who felt threatened by anyone who applied for a job there, but especially if the applicant had a professional certification and then had the nerve to know what they were doing. \n\nThis technician participated in a group technical interview where the applicant was an incredibly bright guy, and had a particular skill that the department really needed.  Problem was, the technician considered himself “the man” when it came to that skill. Recipe for disaster, right? \n\nThe applicant fielded four questions from the rest of us flawlessly, then faced this particular tech for a question. The threatened tech had a list of questions for the interview, but decided to ad lib. Big mistake. He asked a convoluted question that Rube Goldberg would have been proud of. When he was done, the applicant answered: \n\n“You can’t do what you just described.” \n\nThe tech started defending his question, and it became obvious that he hadn’t been able to follow his own question! The interview went into a bit of a meltdown from there. \n\nRealize right now that there are some unprofessional people out there giving technical interviews. Be prepared for it, but remain professional yourself. \n\nBe prepared for a practical technical interview. The best technical interviewers find a way to get you in front of the technology you’ll be working with. A great way to quickly find out whether you know what you’re talking about is to ask you to actually perform common and perhaps some not-so-common tasks.  We can talk about technology and take all the computer-based exams we want, but it all comes down to performance. Be prepared to prove you belong on your interview day. \n\nBe professional.  This covers a lot of ground, so let me make a quick list for you. \n\nShow up 15 minutes early. Nothing makes a technical interviewer more surly than waiting for the applicant. \n\nDress for success.  The way you look when you walk into a room leads to your interviewer’s first impression of you. \n\nDon’t chew gum during the interview. \n\nDon’t be arrogant.  Look, there’s nothing wrong with having an ego and acting confident. I do, and you should. But don’t come into the interview room acting like you’re too good to be there. \n\nFinally, relax. Easy to say, hard to do? Not really. Realize that the majority of interviewers you’ll ever meet are going to be professional about the entire thing. The world’s not going to end if you miss a question. If you were not qualified on paper for the job, you wouldn’t be in there. \n\nDo not look upon the interview as something negative. Rather, look at it as an opportunity to prove you know what you’re talking about. With the proper mental attitude, your technical interview will be a springboard to the next step in your career! \n\nChris Bryant ____________________________________________"},{title:"Cleaning And Organizing Your Computer",body:"It is a good idea to think of your PC as an office. It stores files, programs, pictures. This can be compared to an actual office’s files, machines and decorations. The operating system is the boss. With this image in mind, think of an office you’ve visited that was slow and inefficient. There were probably many different reasons for the inefficiency. This is the same with a computer.  There can be many items that slow down your computer. Perhaps the one most commonly overlooked is disorganization and clutter.\n\nDisk Cleanup\n\nAn office can accumulate a lot of unnecessary files, machines, and decorations. This is the same with your computer. One of the best ways to keep this clutter under control is to perform a cleaning utility periodically. In Windows this cleaning utility will be called a “disk cleanup.” It removes a variety of unnecessary files depending on the options you have selected.\n\nTo perform a disk cleanup on Windows XP you can simply click on “my computer” under the start menu. Than right click on your “c drive” or “hard disk” and choose properties.  Than click “disk cleanup” and follow the prompts. When selecting files to clean up, or delete, Windows will give you information to help you decide. When looking over the list of file types, you would simple click on the name of the file type and read the description placed below in the description area. This will let you know if the files can be safely deleted. To select the file group just check the box next to the group name. When finished selecting press “OK” to finish.\n\nNow, performing a disk cleanup is not very time consuming, just a couple minutes, and it may save more time in the end by making your computer run faster. However, a disk cleanup should be run periodically rather than just once in a great while. One way to make this run periodically is to make it a scheduled task. This will allow your computer to run it automatically with intervals and time of day determined by you. Yet, you can always run it yourself periodically without creating a scheduled task.\n\nAdd or Remove Programs\n\nThe information given above can help you get rid of some unnecessary files, but you may also need to clean out some unnecessary programs as well. This can be done using the “add or remove programs” utility in Windows. This is located in the control panel and lists all of your currently installed programs along with an option to uninstall them. It is a good idea to browse through the add or remove programs utility every once in a while just to make sure that all programs are of usefulness. \n\nIf there are programs listed that are no longer used, you can simply highlight the program and click the uninstall button. Windows will than begin the process to uninstall the program. In most cases, to finish uninstalling a program, it is wise to restart your computer. This will dump and files that are held temporarily. \n\nThe add or remove programs utility is very useful, but not all of the programs are listed up front. Programs that come pre-installed on your computer and the Windows operating system can also be uninstalled. For instance, Outlook Express is a default e-mail program that comes with the Windows XP operating system. If you do not use this e-mail program you can uninstall it. Click “add or remove windows components” found in the add or remove programs utility and simply follow the instructions.\n\nDefragment\n\nMany offices contain a large number of files and programs that are valuable and cannot be thrown away. In fact, they may contain files that are not even used, but still have to be retained for some reason. Although these files must remain in the office, they need to be organized. This is why we create file folders that hold groups of files that are related. Than we store them in cabinets that are arranged in alphabetic order.\n\nIn a computer, the files that are saved are placed on the hard drive. However, they are placed according to the time that they were saved. So, if you open a word document and save the file as “file A” and than open another document and save it as “file B”, you have a “file A” placed next to “file B.” This is fine, but if you open “file A” later on and save it again, than the added information is saved next to “file B.” \n\nWhen files are broken up this way it is referred to as a fragmented file. This means that the computer must find the first part of the file and then find the second part of the file to open that one word document. This can make your computer run slower. However, Windows has created a utility that is meant to rearrange files so that they are no longer fragmented but sit right next to each other.\n\nYou can run the disk defragmenter by selecting “all programs” under the start button. Next, select “accessories” and “system tools” and you will see “disk defragmenter.” In fact, this is also an alternative way to select the disk cleanup mentioned earlier. Before starting the defragmenter you can analyze your hard drive to see if Windows recommends performing the defragmenter. It will either say that you should or should not defragment at this time. \n\nIf you need to defragment your computer, simply hit the defragment button. It may take your computer a while to finish this task depending on the speed of your computer and the amount of defragmented files. It could take from about 15-30 minutes or more. However, you can still use the computer while the disk defragmenter is working."

Needless to say, she writes for an guide to casinos and I hate gambling. But then, she likes it and this supports us too, so I went along without any hassle. At first I was depressed, but then as I asked around and looked around, I ended up having more fun in Las Vegas than I would have thought. And no. I did not enter a single casino while I was there.\n\nEntertainment:\n\nOne of the greatest things about Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City (but especially Las Vegas) is the number of shows that are available. You can get to watch top class comedians like Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Ray Romano, Tim Allen and even the likes of Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. If you are into music you can watch female singers like Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Beyonc?, male performers like Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Snoopy Dog and bands like Oasis and Bon Jovi. I could go on and on but the list is endless. If you are into magic you can watch magicians like David Copperfield do their thing meters from you. Whatever you like, you can find it here from Western music to oldies to Jazz, Rock, Heavy Mettle to Trance. All you have to do is look at the itenary offered during your visit.\n\nFood:\n\nChinese to Japanese to Korean to Jewish and even Vegetarian and proper meat eating establishments await your every delight in Vegas. Do not opt for the cheap and oily fried dishes served for free while you play. Stop a while and take in the delightful scenery and smells of East Asian or European dishes. What is wondrous is that you get to see man’s ability to mix. A real melting pot if I may say so myself.\n\nBut is that all what casino cities like Las Vegas are about? Do you have to remain in the city to really and truly enjoy your stay?\n\nNo.\n\nHere are some of the better attractions you must see on your visit to Vegas:\n\nHoover Dam and the Grand Canyon: Book yourself a seat on any of the many sightseeing tours available and go and watch the architectural marvel that is Hoover Dam built over the Grand canyon which is also a grand sight to see by itself. Black Canyon is another must see as is Lake Mead which is so beautiful just because it is a body of water all surrounded by desert-like nature. Colorado River:\n\nWhile looking at the Dam and Canyon is from above, to see the true beauty of the river, you have to go down. The Colorado river is excellent for river-rafting and water sports, but you do not have to take part if it is not your thing. Instead just sit back and enjoy another of nature’s marvels.\n\nBonnie Springs:\n\nWho can not resist going to one of the old towns like those in the Western gun slinging movies? Your destination needs to be Old Nevada. There you can delight in an old western town right in the middle of Red Rock Canyon. They host western shootouts too so come prepared, partner! I could go on and on about other attractions like the theme park in Circus Circus, the Gilcrease Nature Sanctuary, the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve and Mt. Charleston but I think you get the picture. In Las Vegas and hate gambling? Do not despair. Just go out and have some clean un-gambling fun."},{title:"Live Poker How To Win Tournament Games",body:"Now, if you are interested in being the best player, getting really good money and knowing some tricks and advices of what to do in a live tournament games, here is the best place to learn them.\n\n1) Try not to get drunk\n\nSome of the people that are playing, and that have few rounds to play in the tournament don’t count the drinks they have during their games and at the very end of the day they don’t have power to continue till the last game, which is a pity to loose such a big opportunity, so, don’t drink a lot and be prepare for the last round, also come up with all your senses in order. If you drink, do it measurable and just to loose the nerves before the games but also have some other drinks like soda, water, coffee and others to hydrate your self. 2) Is it important where I sit? Yes it is, in a tournament try not to sit next to the dealer, take a place in where you will feel that you are in front of the dealer to have the feeling that he is giving you a game. Also in a place where you will feel comfortable with your self and you will have a perspective of the other players.\n\n3) Make your self comfortable while playing\n\nDon’t show the other players with your position what you cards are telling you. Make sure to seat back and relax, don’t adopt positions that will make you move too much or feel uncomfortable during the time of the game. Some players in the tournaments show their game with the position they adopt while playing either putting the elbows on the table or resting in the bumper. 4) Do the most important thing in the brake.\n\nDon’t get distracted from what you really need to do in the brake. Take your time to go to the bathroom and rest, sometimes the discussions about the previous game or lines for getting drinks will waste your time for what is really important.\n\n5) Also your words and mimic are important during the game.\n\nWhen ever you are playing don’t show your cards to the other player in the way you talk or look, is important that they will have other impression, for example in your hand Is good you can try on making faces or saying words that show that your hand is not good, then people will think you have a bad game and you will surprise them at the end. This doesn’t work all the time so try to find different ways to hide your game.Also you can read the other player’s movements and words to see either they are lying or telling the truth in the hand."},{title:"The Flash Tutorial",body:"Finding the perfect learning tool for Flash is a daunting task to any novice web developer. One can find help in a number of ways through books, friends and private tutors. These methods are great but not often readily available, nor cheap! The best and cheapest way to learn anything from the basics of flash to the secrets of the trade is a Flash Tutorial. Think of the Flash Tutorial as a mini lesson that teaches a specific part of the flash. 	Flash Tutorials come in many levels of difficulty and quality. Developers don’t publish their tutorials according to an established curriculum, they simple publish whatever they please or think will be useful. That makes finding the correct Flash Tutorial difficult. Many times the tutorial is too vague and the information is difficult to understand. Conversely, the concepts could be easy to understand but entirely useless in the real world. If a person will examine the quality of the tutorial before they work through it, they will be able to avoid a lot of unnecessary frustration. When selecting a Flash Tutorial, look for these three criteria: examples, clarity, and usefulness.  Examples When looking for a Flash Tutorial, be sure that it has examples to go with it. Examples are actual snippets of code that actually demonstrate the principles taught in the tutorial. If the source code is downloadable as an example file for you to look at and run, that is even better. Look for examples that are easy to follow and demonstrate clearly the principle being taught. There is nothing more frustrating than finding the perfect tutorial and not having the perfect example to work from. \n\nClarity Find Flash Tutorials that are clear and easy to understand. If a flash dictionary is needed, then the tutorial is not worth your time. Tutorials should be written clearly and concisely. It is best when the author has put links to the definition of, or clarifies a difficult word. Generally, it is also helpful when the tutorial has visuals. That being said, not all visuals are effective. The visuals should clarify and not confuse. \n\nUsefulness Above all tutorials should be useful. They should teach things that can actually be used. It is great when the tutorial teaches how to effectively use the feature in a real-life situation. A good Flash Tutorial will be adaptable. The user should be able to take the examples and adapt them to their application without having to entirely redo the process. Finally, the tutorial should teach the entire concept. This can be in one lesson or in many lessons, but it should teach everything the user needs to know to implement that concept. When looking for tutorials remember that it must have example, it must be clear and it must be useful. If you’re a basic user start searching for “Basic Flash Tutorials”. As you get more advanced, search for specific topics such as character creation or Flash shape tweening. Remember, the first tutorial that comes up on the search isn’t always the best. They have to be sifted through until the really good ones are found."},{title:"Video Games Playing With Imagination",body:"It won’t be a bigger problem to find one video game lover in your neighbor. Since the introduction of Virtual Game, it has been achieving great heights so far as its popularity and technological advancement are concerned. The history of video game is as interesting as a fairy tale. The quality of today’s video game was not at all there when video game first conceptualized and played ever. During the formulative years, video games were created by using various interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The first ever video game was designed in 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. (Source: Wikipedia.org) The device was recognized as Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device. From Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device to Xbox 360, PlayStation series or Nintendo WII, the story behind video games and accessories is really very creative and adventurous. Recently played video games are quite developed and they are more interactive than the earlier video games. From analog video game design to 2D and 3D video games all have their own charm and video game lovers try to play all sorts of video games. In this respect our team talked to John, who lives in Sidney, Australia. When he was asked about his preference about the type of video game, he replied, “Let me make it clear from the very beginning that I’m really crazy about video games. I’ve been playing video games since I gained consciousness…LOL…Really I’m serious. My father owns a video game store here in Sidney and we are still managing the same store. The only difference that you may find is the shelves. The old analog video games were replaced by 2D and 3D video games. We have several regular customers and they very often come to our store and ask for the LATEST. I too ask about their preference and they say they love to try any sort of video games. What ever that is competitive, they love to play. So far playing excitement of video games is concerned, they can be compared with the soccer match between Manchester United and Liverpool.”\n\nIt’s not the quality of video games that improves, researches and developments are too evident in video game accessories, too. Without such accessories, the real excitement of video games can not be enjoyed. It’s pretty easy to recognize video game accessories. The video game accessories are just like computer hard wares. If video games are software, the most important video game accessories are consoles and D-pad. Currently several companies are manufacturing video game accessories. Some of the major players in the industry are Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft’s Xbox 360, Sony’s PlayStation series and Nintendo’s WII are high in demand.\n\nXbox 360 is the second video game console introduced by Microsoft in the video game industry. This was developed in association with IBM, ATI and SiS. Xbox Live service enables players to compete online as well as players can download other relevant content from internet. Xbox 360 is the seventh generation game console and currently challenged by Sony’s Play Station 3 and Nintendo’s WII in the market.

Although, Lycoris, Red Hat, Mandrake, Suse, Knoppix, Slackware and Lindows make up some of the different versions of LINUX. These companies release their own versions of the operating systems with minor changes, and yet always with the same bottom line. The simple fact that not one of these companies are close to competing with Windows, for the most part causes the difference in market share.\n\nIt sometimes seems everyone on the planet is using Windows. Many say Windows is way better than LINUX because of the simple handling of the software or hardware. There are huge differences between the number of users of LINUX and Windows. Many say LINUX is far better because it started as an Open Source software and thus is more flexible than Windows. Then what accounts for the enormous difference in market share between these two operating systems?\n\nWindows and Linux are different in many ways. \n\n1. Windows GUI is an integral component of the OS; speed, efficiency and reliability, while the Linux GUI is optional, are increased by running a server instance of Linux without a GUI, something that server versions of Windows simply can’t do. The nature of the Linux GUI makes remote administration of a Linux computer easier with a more natural feel than Windows computers.\n\n2. The command prompts of the operating systems are very different. The command interpreters in the Windows 9x series are very similar to each other and the NT class versions of Windows also have similar command interpreters. There are, however differences between a Windows 9x command interpreter and one in an NT class flavor of Windows. Linux, like UNIX, also supports multiple command interpreters, but it usually uses BASH or “Bourne Again Shell”.\n\n3. While you have to pay hundred’s of dollars for a new Windows version, you can just go download Linux. There’s no manuals or simple installers for the free version. Although there is quite a learning curve when utilizing the free package. There are some easy automated packages of Linux for low prices.\n\nMicrosoft’s “big con” is the supposed security issues with windows. Most spyware, adware and malicious files programs work with Windows just fine. In general you do not deal with these kinds of circumstances unless you are working with Windows. whereas Linux offers a strong protection, password protection for Windows can be bypassed with ease.\n\nThe software availability is the key to why Windows wins over Linux in this competition. Most software releases are already configured for Windows. If you chose to use Linux you must copy Windows with special software in order to use your windows based programs. You could always install Windows as a subsystem to Linux, this would take the administrative capabilities of Windows and allow them to funtion on Linux.\n\nIf Linux is ever to compete with Windows, it must become more user friendly and provide serious technical support."},{title:"Choosing The Best Audio Player Software For Your Computer",body:"Audio player software is used to play back sound recordings in one of the many formats available for computers today. It can also play back music CDs. There is audio player software that is native to the computer’s operating system (Windows, Macintosh, and Linux) and there are web-based audio players. This article discusses the local computer audio players. Advantages of computer audio player software\n\nThe main advantage of a computer audio player is that you can play your audio CDs and there is no longer any need to have a separate CD player. However the capabilities of the computer audio player go beyond just playing traditional music CDs. You can also play sound clips in one of the many audio formats found in the information technology industry today. The MP3 format is a standard whereby a high rate of compression can be achieved on sound files allowing the ability to store large numbers of them on hard disk. Another advantage is when the computer audio player has ripping capability you can extract a sample clip from the sound track for internet posting or emailing. Audio players in the form of portable MP3 players like Apple’s iPod are extremely advantageous due to their long battery life and capability to be carried practically anywhere. Choosing and using a computer audio player\n\nWindows comes with Windows Media Player already installed. Realplayer is a free download as well. There are other free products such as Winamp (Windows only). One important feature you want to look for when choosing an audio player beyond what is packaged with your operating system is the sound filtering capabilities. It should at least have a graphic equalizer where you can adjust for poor quality sound files. Look for other features like the ability to rip sound tracks and change the skins of the computer audio player. The demand for the computer audio player\n\nDemand is driven by price and the free audio players like Windows Media Player will remain popular when it comes to playing audio on the computer. Where people are spending more of their money is on the portable MP3 players like Apple’s iPod. Apple makes a free computer audio player for the computer called iTunes and it is used to organize play lists and transfer sound files to the iPod player. Typically, you download iTunes and install it on your computer and then you have an integrated environment to import different types of Podcasts and audio for exporting to the iPod player itself. Plus iTunes can be used as a standalone computer audio player. But more and more you will see the demand for mobile computer audio players to increase because of their convenience and portability."},{title:"Addiction When Gambling Becomes A Problem",body:"While most people enjoy casino gambling, sports betting, lottery and bingo playing for the fun and excitement it provides, others may experience gambling as an addictive and distractive habit.

The best way to verify the proper usage of your PC is to use the software known as monitoring, spy or surveillance software, developed to record user’s activities on a computer. Such software can be easily purchased and downloaded from vendor’s websites. But sometimes the word “spy” appeals to our ethical issues. Can such software be classified as spyware?\n\nAs soon as we ask this question we might have the reason to use spy software. And, first of all we should ask ourselves what do we need it for: to protect or to attack. If we have good intentions, all means are good. The thing is that any tool can be used for very different purposes. Imagine what can be done with bread knife other then slicing bread for family dinner. We shouldn’t be afraid of a weapon we should be afraid of a man carrying it.  MG WAY CORP launched its pilot version of computer monitoring software MG-Shadow last year.

Since the introduction of Virtual Game, it has been achieving great heights so far as its popularity and technological advancement are concerned. The history of video game is as interesting as a fairy tale. The quality of today’s video game was not at all there when video game first conceptualized and played ever. During the formulative years, video games were created by using various interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The first ever video game was designed in 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. (Source: Wikipedia.org) The device was recognized as Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device. From Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device to Xbox 360, PlayStation series or Nintendo WII, the story behind video games and accessories is really very creative and adventurous. Recently played video games are quite developed and they are more interactive than the earlier video games. From analog video game design to 2D and 3D video games all have their own charm and video game lovers try to play all sorts of video games. In this respect our team talked to John, who lives in Sidney, Australia. When he was asked about his preference about the type of video game, he replied, “Let me make it clear from the very beginning that I’m really crazy about video games. I’ve been playing video games since I gained consciousness…LOL…Really I’m serious. My father owns a video game store here in Sidney and we are still managing the same store. The only difference that you may find is the shelves. The old analog video games were replaced by 2D and 3D video games. We have several regular customers and they very often come to our store and ask for the LATEST. I too ask about their preference and they say they love to try any sort of video games. What ever that is competitive, they love to play. So far playing excitement of video games is concerned, they can be compared with the soccer match between Manchester United and Liverpool.”\n\nIt’s not the quality of video games that improves, researches and developments are too evident in video game accessories, too. Without such accessories, the real excitement of video games can not be enjoyed. It’s pretty easy to recognize video game accessories. The video game accessories are just like computer hard wares. If video games are software, the most important video game accessories are consoles and D-pad. Currently several companies are manufacturing video game accessories. Some of the major players in the industry are Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft’s Xbox 360, Sony’s PlayStation series and Nintendo’s WII are high in demand.\n\nXbox 360 is the second video game console introduced by Microsoft in the video game industry. This was developed in association with IBM, ATI and SiS. Xbox Live service enables players to compete online as well as players can download other relevant content from internet. Xbox 360 is the seventh generation game console and currently challenged by Sony’s Play Station 3 and Nintendo’s WII in the market. Xbox 360 has broken several video market records as it has completely been sold out on its first launch except in Japan. Till January 3, 2008, 17.7 million pieces are sold out with 6.3 million in the United States only. Are you feeling the heat of video game?

},{title:"Linux Or Windows Which Is It",body:"Computer users and programmers have become so accustomed to using Windows, even for the changing capabilities and the appearances of the graphical interface of the versions, therefore it has remained Microsoft’s product. Although, Lycoris, Red Hat, Mandrake, Suse, Knoppix, Slackware and Lindows make up some of the different versions of LINUX. These companies release their own versions of the operating systems with minor changes, and yet always with the same bottom line. The simple fact that not one of these companies are close to competing with Windows, for the most part causes the difference in market share.\n\nIt sometimes seems everyone on the planet is using Windows. Many say Windows is way better than LINUX because of the simple handling of the software or hardware. There are huge differences between the number of users of LINUX and Windows. Many say LINUX is far better because it started as an Open Source software and thus is more flexible than Windows. Then what accounts for the enormous difference in market share between these two operating systems?\n\nWindows and Linux are different in many ways. \n\n1. Windows GUI is an integral component of the OS; speed, efficiency and reliability, while the Linux GUI is optional, are increased by running a server instance of Linux without a GUI, something that server versions of Windows simply can’t do. The nature of the Linux GUI makes remote administration of a Linux computer easier with a more natural feel than Windows computers.\n\n2. The command prompts of the operating systems are very different. The command interpreters in the Windows 9x series are very similar to each other and the NT class versions of Windows also have similar command interpreters. There are, however differences between a Windows 9x command interpreter and one in an NT class flavor of Windows. Linux, like UNIX, also supports multiple command interpreters, but it usually uses BASH or “Bourne Again Shell”.\n\n3. While you have to pay hundred’s of dollars for a new Windows version, you can just go download Linux. There’s no manuals or simple installers for the free version. Although there is quite a learning curve when utilizing the free package. There are some easy automated packages of Linux for low prices.\n\nMicrosoft’s “big con” is the supposed security issues with windows. Most spyware, adware and malicious files programs work with Windows just fine. In general you do not deal with these kinds of circumstances unless you are working with Windows. whereas Linux offers a strong protection, password protection for Windows can be bypassed with ease.\n\nThe software availability is the key to why Windows wins over Linux in this competition. Most software releases are already configured for Windows. If you chose to use Linux you must copy Windows with special software in order to use your windows based programs. You could always install Windows as a subsystem to Linux, this would take the administrative capabilities of Windows and allow them to funtion on Linux.\n\nIf Linux is ever to compete with Windows, it must become more user friendly and provide serious technical support."},{title:"Choosing The Best Audio Player Software For Your Computer",body:"Audio player software is used to play back sound recordings in one of the many formats available for computers today. It can also play back music CDs. There is audio player software that is native to the computer’s operating system (Windows, Macintosh, and Linux) and there are web-based audio players. This article discusses the local computer audio players. Advantages of computer audio player software\n\nThe main advantage of a computer audio player is that you can play your audio CDs and there is no longer any need to have a separate CD player. However the capabilities of the computer audio player go beyond just playing traditional music CDs. You can also play sound clips in one of the many audio formats found in the information technology industry today. The MP3 format is a standard whereby a high rate of compression can be achieved on sound files allowing the ability to store large numbers of them on hard disk. Another advantage is when the computer audio player has ripping capability you can extract a sample clip from the sound track for internet posting or emailing. Audio players in the form of portable MP3 players like Apple’s iPod are extremely advantageous due to their long battery life and capability to be carried practically anywhere. Choosing and using a computer audio player\n\nWindows comes with Windows Media Player already installed. Realplayer is a free download as well. There are other free products such as Winamp (Windows only). One important feature you want to look for when choosing an audio player beyond what is packaged with your operating system is the sound filtering capabilities. It should at least have a graphic equalizer where you can adjust for poor quality sound files. Look for other features like the ability to rip sound tracks and change the skins of the computer audio player. The demand for the computer audio player\n\nDemand is driven by price and the free audio players like Windows Media Player will remain popular when it comes to playing audio on the computer. Where people are spending more of their money is on the portable MP3 players like Apple’s iPod. Apple makes a free computer audio player for the computer called iTunes and it is used to organize play lists and transfer sound files to the iPod player. Typically, you download iTunes and install it on your computer and then you have an integrated environment to import different types of Podcasts and audio for exporting to the iPod player itself. Plus iTunes can be used as a standalone computer audio player. But more and more you will see the demand for mobile computer audio players to increase because of their convenience and portability."},{title:"Addiction When Gambling Becomes A Problem",body:"While most people enjoy casino gambling, sports betting, lottery and bingo playing for the fun and excitement it provides, others may experience gambling as an addictive and distractive habit.

If so, reading this article could save you from getting in to a lot of trouble! Downloading music to your Ipod has more than one pitfall associated with it, and this article will tell you the best way to download free song for Ipod.\n\nAn Ipod can easily become a vital part of your life. If you had thought about the possibility of carrying around a virtually unlimited supply of music ten years ago, it would have seemed a bit futuristic, but it has all happened, and now all we have to do when we get tired of our present music collection is download free song for Ipod. This could however, be the start of a few problems…\n\nProblem 1-\n\nYour computer picks up a virus. You did an internet search, looking to download free song for Ipod, and, totally without knowing, you downloaded some nasty spyware or malware from a dodgy p2p site. Your laptop has now stopped working, and your Ipod is now only usable as a bookmark. P2P sites can appear to be the answer to your prayers. You can download as much as you want, many different version of songs etc, but you have probably noticed that you often download a file, and it is completely different from what it is supposed to be. In case you have ever wondered why this is, the answer is spyware. If you have downloaded from a site like this, get your computer seen to. If your computer has been infected, it can not only harm your computer, but also your Ipod. Free Ipod music download can cost you very dearly.\n\nProblem 2-\n\nIt is illegal.

From your wrist watch to your laptop, a lot of the on the go electronics that we tote from place to place are only possible because of their thin, light LCD display screens. Liquid crystal display (LCD) technology still has some stumbling blocks in its path that can make it unreliable at times, but on the whole the invention of the LCD screen has allowed great leaps forward in global technological progress.\n\nAlthough liquid crystals are not really liquid, their molecules behave more like a liquid than they do like a solid, which earns them their name. The crystals in an LCD exist in a kind of a unique middle ground between solid form and liquid form, which gives them the movement and flexibility of a liquid; but can also let them remain in place, like a solid. Heat can quickly melt a solid to liquid, allowing it to move, whereas cool will make the liquid solidify almost instantly. The sensitivity of liquid crystals to temperature can be an advantage, or a disadvantage. It allows for the highly successful use of liquid crystals in devices like thermometers, where temperature responsiveness is a boon; but this same property can unfortunately make LCD screens unreliable in extreme climates.\n\nIn an LCD screen, electric currents work at a microscopic level to control the amount of light that passes through the liquid crystal molecules that make up the moving layer of the screen, which is sandwiched between clear glass panels. The currents can force the naturally twisted molecules to unwind or coil tighter, thereby changing the amount of light that can pass from the bulb behind the glass to the eye of the viewer. It may help you understand this process by imagining that light filters through an LCD screen the same way that sunlight filters through the leaves of a tree. Now, imagine that the tree is being blown in the wind, and you will see that the amount and placement of the light that comes through the leaves changes. This is very similar to the dynamic that powers an LCD screen, except that the sun is a small light bulb, the leaves are molecules of liquid crystal, and the wind is made up of electric currents sent by the computer and designed to create a specific light pattern that your eye will interpret as words or images."},{title:"5 Reasons To Choose A Notebook Over A Computer Desktop",body:"Many of us are so used to working on a computer desktop that when it comes time to purchase a new computer, we don’t consider other options. Today, computer notebooks – which were once called laptops – offer a number of advantages over a computer desktop. Here are just five reasons why you should take a second look at notebooks.\n\n1. Mobility\n\nYou might be used to pulling up a chair to your computer, but it makes much more sense to pull your computer up to your chair. Laptops can certainly be used at your desk, but you also have the option of bringing them to the spot where you’re most comfortable. Maybe you’d like to surf the Web in the evening out in the living room or catch up on your favorite blogs before bedtime. Notebooks with wireless connectivity can travel with you throughout your home, so you can check your email or do your Internet shopping anywhere. Of course, notebooks also make sense for those who are on the go. Students can take laptops to class and to the library, while businesspeople can take them along while traveling. With WiFi so widely available, it even makes sense to have a notebook while on vacation. With the right notebook, it’s easy to take photos with your digital camera, upload them, and email them to friends and family before you even get back home. Or you can use it to write a vacation blog and include those pictures from your digital camera.\n\n2. Better Displays\n\nThe size and quality of computer notebook displays has improved so dramatically that there’s little difference between laptops and a computer desktop. For example, you can get Apple’s MacBook with a 13.3-inch LCD widescreen (1280 x 800 pixels), a 15.4-inch LCD widescreen (1440 x 900 pixels) or a 17-inch widescreen (1680 x 1050 pixels). Similarly, the Compaq Presario has a 15.4-inch display. 3. Lighter Weight\n\nJust a few years ago, even the lightest notebook was a pain to lug around. Today, though, laptops are increasingly easy on the back. The MacBook is slightly over an inch thick and the Toshiba Portege weighs in at about four pounds. While that’s still heavy compared to come of the new ultralight convertibles (Fujitsu’s LifeBook U810 weighs only a pound and half), it’s a significant improvement over the old seven-pound laptops. 4. Better Computing and Battery Power\n\nHistorically, two drawbacks of notebooks were their limited RAM, limited space on the hard drive, and short battery life. Times have changed, though, and laptops now have as much power under the hood as their computer desktop cousins. The MacBook, for example, has 1GB of memory (configurable up to 4 GB) and a hard drive that’s configurable to 250GB. This means that your software will hum right along and you’ll be able to zip through programs as quickly and as easily as you do on your desktop. Likewise, batteries in today’s notebooks don’t heat up and don’t conk out. 5. More Features\n\nIn older laptops, the computer’s size and weight limited the number and types of features available. Today, with smaller processors and other components, there’s room to pack more features into notebooks. For example, the MacBook has a DVD player, built-in webcam, built-in wireless capability, two USB ports and a FireWire port, built-in microphone, and audio and digital input/output.\n\nThere are so many advantages to owning notebooks that, before you buy your next computer, it’s worth your while to take one for a spin."},{title:"Buying Used Electronic Test Equipment What S The Difference Between Used Refurbished Remarketed And Rebuilt",body:"According to the research firm Frost & Sullivan, the estimated size of the North American used test and measurement equipment market was $446.4 million in 2004 and is estimated to grow to $654.5 million by 2011. For over 50 years, companies and governments have procured used test and measurement instruments in order to realize a number of benefits including the need to:\n\n– reduce equipment acquisition costs,\n\n– replace discontinued testing instruments,\n\n– circumvent lengthy new product delivery times, and\n\n– conform to legacy standards and specifications.\n\nAlthough there are many considerations when purchasing used test and measurement instruments, the quality of the instrument and reliability of the vendor should be at the top of the list. Used test equipment vendors deploy a number of bywords that represent the equipment they sell, including “refurbished”, “remarketed”, “reconditioned”, “rebuilt” and, the obvious, “used”. These marketing adjectives typically imply various quality processes and buyers of used test equipment should execute their due diligence prior to purchasing.\n\n“Used” or “Remarketed” equipment often describes products sold with an “as-is” supposition. You might purchase used equipment from an end-user organization or auction company that is selling surplus assets. Products sold as “used” should be priced at the lower scale of the market spectrum and it is not uncommon for quality issues to arise with “used” equipment. It is likely that the instruments have not been tested and have an uncertain history. It is only prudent to purchase “Used” equipment if you have the in-house repair and calibration facilities/expertise and are able to procure the item at a cost low enough that the added expense of repair and calibration remains to be a positive, economical outcome.\n\n“Refurbished and Reconditioned” are akin and are the most common presentment of used equipment from equipment dealers. Refurbished equipment is fully tested and calibrated to NIST standards to assure that they meet the original manufacturers’ specifications. Refurbished equipment should come with all standard accessories and operating manuals. Malfunctioning internal components will have been replaced or repaired and the product will have been cosmetically cared for including painting and the replacing of face plates, button and knobs. Refurbished equipment is typically sold with a 30-90 day parts/labor warranty and is priced in the middle to high-end of the market spectrum.\n\nFinally, some vendors advertised “Rebuilt” test equipment. Many instrument options are field-installable and can be built-to-order according to the customer’s requirements. Some products can even be converted from one generation or version to the next by adding various components. There is absolutely nothing wrong with purchasing rebuilt equipment and, in fact, if you can not find the exact product configuration you are sourcing, you should ask qualified vendors about the possibility adding those options. As with used and refurbished equipment, always exercise caution in choosing a vendor. Assure that the vendor is qualified or uses a qualified electronics laboratory to repair, calibrate and rebuild the products you seek.\n\nPurchasing used, refurbished or rebuilt electronic test equipment is a great way for organizations to save 30-70% on their asset acquisition costs. Warranties and guarantees from used test equipment vendors are formidable. In select product groups, the original equipment manufacturers offer extended warranties in partnership with the vendors that are the selling those products.\n\nExercise caution and perform due diligence on your vendors. It is most effective to first identify a qualified used equipment vendor and begin a supplier relationship, as opposed to sourcing each instrument you need individually. If your qualified vendor does not have what you are looking for in inventory, it is likely that they will be able to locate it within 24 hours. By first identifying and working with a select few vendors, you will assure consistent quality and economical pricing with every used test equipment purchase."},{title:"Compatible Inkjet Cartridge",body:"Once the printer ink runs dry it has to be replaced with another inkjet cartridge.

The best part of the new version is the security patch; the new “nonce” security key reduces the chances of a malicious hacker finding a way into your admin panel. Besides the security patch, though, several minor bugs have been squashed with this version. Though a major upgrade to 2.1 is due out soon, the 2.0.3 is something you should definitely download and install if only because of the security fixes, which were actually backported from the major upgrade files.\n\nIn addition to the 2.0.3 install, you should be aware that some bugs have already been found, and that a plugin will need to be installed to repair those bugs. If you modify any of the files that this patch plugin fixes, you’ll need to either merge the changes with the new files or make those changes manually once again.

They did the scans by transmitting x-ray streams all the way through the head at different positions and accumulating the x-ray streams on the other side that was not absorbed by the head. A sequence of images come into view on a computer monitor or on an x-ray plate as if the head had been sliced from side to side by a huge salami cutter and the slices were arranged out horizontally and in series.\n\nAfter that, in the 1980s Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI scans came into the picture and astounded the medical society by not just taking an image of the brain itself, but by doing so in a new way. MRIs concentrate on water molecules, as an alternative to imaging the degree to which the various parts of the head absorb x-rays. To be more specific, MRIs represent the speed at which rotating hydrogen atoms of water molecules inside various parts of the brain either line up or fall out of arrangement with a powerful magnetic field. These different values of de-magnetization or magnetization are inputted into a pc. Slice like images are formed in a sequence and put on view on a computer screen or x-ray type film in hues of gray. Irregular compositions, like brain tumors or the signs of multiple sclerosis, are shown in their own hues of gray and are also identifiable by their contours and positions. More on this at http://www.medicalimagingdevices.info. Getting hold of a different set of images after a hypodermal injection of gadolinium, which is the MRI equivalent of x-ray dye, also adds to analytical information.\n\nFor a patient, the incident of having a CT and of having an MRI very much looks a lot like each other. In both situations the patient lies flat on a plane table that moves into and out of a hole in the scanner that looks a lot like an oversize doughnut hole. In the MRI machine the doughnut hole is narrower, so patients suffering from claustrophobia have to notify their doctors if this might be a hitch. Noise is also an issue with the MRI machine. A loud noise is produced every time the radio frequency coils are turned off and on. For either of these two scans the technologist may need to inject a needle in the patient’s vein to dispense a distinct substance.\n\nA situation in which MRIs are basically not done is when the patient has a heart pacemaker. This is for the reason that the MRI machine’s magnet might disturb the pacemaker and stop the heart. No image is so essential and important that this peril would be worth taking. Another situation in which an MRI is evaded is when the patient is gravely ill. A serious patient can be effectively examined and sustained while getting a CT scan, but not while getting an MRI."},{title:"What Is Hdmi",body:"HDMI, or high definition multimedia interface, is a type of audio and video interface that is used for the transmission of uncompressed digital streams. Essentially, HDMI can be considered an alternative method to transmitting data streams, rather than making use of conventional methods such as coaxial cabling, VGA, or component video equipment. What Type of Sources May Be Employed Using HDMI?\n\nQuite a number of devices and sources on the market today will work with the use of HDMI. The Blu-Ray disc player, a relatively new innovation, was created with the use of HDMI specifically in mind. Most personal computers that are sold today are ready for use with HDMI, as are the majority of video game consoles in the stores currently. A set-top box also is usually compatible with HDMI, as are such entertainment options as digital television. Essentially, any type of computer interface today will function with the use of HDMI. How Does HDMI Work?\n\nHDMI will work with a single cable connection to such devices as televisions or personal computers. In general, HDMI will function fine with any television or PC that is standard, enhanced, or high definition in the video component. However, it is important to note that HDMI does work independently of many of the DTV standards, although use of HDMI will not impact the quality of the digital transmission. Generally, these standards apply to some configurations of MPEG movie clips and files. Since these are compressed, HDMI will simply decompress the data and make it possible to view the clip. Are All HDMI Versions The Same For All Devices?\n\nNo. There is a range of specifications that are employed by HDMI, and a given device will be manufactured to comply with one of those specifications. The most simplistic specification is identified as 1.0. With each succeeding version, the capabilities of the previous version remain intact, but are joined by other capabilities that will allow the version to function with a given device. Because technology is always advancing, HDMI continues to advance as well. However, older versions remain active, as they are often used with devices that require less functionality, and they also continue to be helpful in situations where older systems are still running and are in operation. Where Did HDMI Come From?\n\nHDMI was created and has been enhanced by the efforts of several prominent names in the computer and electronics industry. Consumers will recognize the names of Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Silicon Image as just part of the roster of corporations involved in the ongoing enhancement of HDMI."},{title:"Dvd Replication For Dummies 4 Easy Steps To Professional Dvd Replication",body:"Every avid independent filmmaker has dreamed about making that special interest documentary, or short film to show off their creative prowess. Many have great ideas and want to “wow” the film-festival scene, or video renters with their big project.  But once you have the film “in the can” (no easy feat), how do you move from a couple of master DVDs with the “Sharpie” marked hand-written title inside a secondhand CD case, to a pile of cardboard boxes full of shiny new, retail-ready DVDs, with UPC barcodes and polywrap sitting on your doorstep?  You need to create eye-popping artwork and have your project replicated. Using a reputable full service DVD Replication company like PacificDisc, Inc. to partner with is certainly a helpful option to ensure a professional end result, but to help with your DVD replication project, here are 4 easy steps to follow for good DVD replication results: \n\n1. Prepare your DVD master.\n\nTo ensure the replication company can read your master, you either need to create a DVD-R master, or output your project to a DLT (Digital Linear Tape). DLT has been around for years and used to be the only way to replicate. Thankfully DVD-R technology has advanced so much over the past few years, that a pair of DVD-R masters are normally all that is required when working on a standard DVD5 project. Why a pair? Just in case one of the masters gets damaged in transit, you don’t waste time looking for another good master. \n\n2. Create your artwork\n\nYou’ll need to design artwork for the DVD face, the outside of the case (commonly called a wrap) and, if desired an insert for the inside of the case (postcard, or booklet). All CD or DVD Replication companies will have templates on their websites that you can download and use to assist in layout of your art. Just make sure you download the correct template for your project, as there are many variables and you won’t want to waste time with the wrong layout.  While on the subject of artwork, it’s important to mention that you need to decide if your project needs a barcode (commonly called a UPC, or the black and white dashes inside a box on many products). If your DVD will be sold through retailers, you should have a UPC issued, as many retailers won’t stock an item without one.  3. Find a DVD replication partner\n\nAlthough there are literally dozens of DVD replication companies out there (just type “dvd replication company” into your favorite search engine) not all DVD Replication companies are created equal. You’ll see all kinds of pricing models that will do an excellent job of confusing the heck out of you. Instead look for a partner who offers good pricing and tries to simplify the process. Make sure you are comparing the same thing when shopping around and watch out for hidden extras, like overage (where the replication company makes an extra bunch of discs and then expects you to pay for the extras). Watch out for setup fees, glass mastering fees, extra costs for offset printed discs, extra costs for 3-color vs. 5-color artwork.  A little homework up front will ensure your DVDs look great when they arrive and you aren’t left with the feeling of being cheated, or have crappy looking discs that nobody will want to buy. \n\n4. Approve check discs and artwork proofs\n\nOnce you have found the DVD replication company, you will be asked to send in your masters, artwork and cash. Most replicators want their money upfront, as they start burning materials as soon as the project lands. Within a few days of delivering your masters, you should see either email proofs of your artwork (simple digital prints (PDFs) showing you how your art elements will line up when printed. If you ordered a hard proof, the DVD replication company will ship you a print proof printed from the actual printing press earmarked to print your job. With a hard proof, you know exactly what you’re getting before you print hundreds of them. If you request a check disc, you’ll get a small number of “silver discs” to ensure your project has come through the DVD-R (or DLT) master to “glass” master process successfully. \n\nAssuming everything checks out, and you send back your approvals, within a couple of weeks, you should hear the beep-beep-beep of the FedEx truck backing up your driveway. After a quick signature, you should be the proud owner of a pile of cardboard boxes filled with shiny DVDs — your DVDs!"},{title:"Going Wireless With Your Headphones",body:"If you’re looking for the latest in wireless headphones for your enjoyment and private listening, whether to TV, stereo, home entertainment such as theater, iTunes or Ipod, you might do well to look at the highly recommended Sennheiser RS 130 wireless headphones.\n\nThese state of the art wireless headphones provide an advanced communication via FM radio frequency.

You did an internet search, looking to download free song for Ipod, and, totally without knowing, you downloaded some nasty spyware or malware from a dodgy p2p site. Your laptop has now stopped working, and your Ipod is now only usable as a bookmark. P2P sites can appear to be the answer to your prayers. You can download as much as you want, many different version of songs etc, but you have probably noticed that you often download a file, and it is completely different from what it is supposed to be. In case you have ever wondered why this is, the answer is spyware. If you have downloaded from a site like this, get your computer seen to. If your computer has been infected, it can not only harm your computer, but also your Ipod. Free Ipod music download can cost you very dearly.\n\nProblem 2-\n\nIt is illegal.

The only downside to these types of site is that they have to charge you a membership fee, usually somewhere around $20 to $50, and that covers you for LIFE. You can download an unlimited amount of music and films, as soon as you have paid the fee. It is definitely not difficult to download more than $50 worth of music.

From your wrist watch to your laptop, a lot of the on the go electronics that we tote from place to place are only possible because of their thin, light LCD display screens. Liquid crystal display (LCD) technology still has some stumbling blocks in its path that can make it unreliable at times, but on the whole the invention of the LCD screen has allowed great leaps forward in global technological progress.\n\nAlthough liquid crystals are not really liquid, their molecules behave more like a liquid than they do like a solid, which earns them their name. The crystals in an LCD exist in a kind of a unique middle ground between solid form and liquid form, which gives them the movement and flexibility of a liquid; but can also let them remain in place, like a solid. Heat can quickly melt a solid to liquid, allowing it to move, whereas cool will make the liquid solidify almost instantly. The sensitivity of liquid crystals to temperature can be an advantage, or a disadvantage. It allows for the highly successful use of liquid crystals in devices like thermometers, where temperature responsiveness is a boon; but this same property can unfortunately make LCD screens unreliable in extreme climates.\n\nIn an LCD screen, electric currents work at a microscopic level to control the amount of light that passes through the liquid crystal molecules that make up the moving layer of the screen, which is sandwiched between clear glass panels. The currents can force the naturally twisted molecules to unwind or coil tighter, thereby changing the amount of light that can pass from the bulb behind the glass to the eye of the viewer. It may help you understand this process by imagining that light filters through an LCD screen the same way that sunlight filters through the leaves of a tree. Now, imagine that the tree is being blown in the wind, and you will see that the amount and placement of the light that comes through the leaves changes. This is very similar to the dynamic that powers an LCD screen, except that the sun is a small light bulb, the leaves are molecules of liquid crystal, and the wind is made up of electric currents sent by the computer and designed to create a specific light pattern that your eye will interpret as words or images."},{title:"Windows Registry Cleaner Checklist",body:"Over 92% of computers are infected with Adware and spyware. Such software is rarely accompanied by uninstall utility and even when it is it almost always leaves broken Windows Registry keys behind it. Even if you have an anti-spyware tool your Windows Registry might be broken – developers of those tools are focused on removing Adware and spyware functionality, not every trace of software itself.\n\nAnother category of software that is known to leave bits and pieces behind on uninstallation is games. There are a lot of special installation systems that creates strange files, unique entries in your registry file as well as changes system dll’s to other versions.

Do some searches on the Internet. Who knows? You might find an area, a niche, that is just waiting for you to fill it with useful information.\n\nThere’s a lot more to affiliate marketing, of course. But the first step is to find your passion. Your “passion” doesn’t have to be making money on the Internet. It can be cooking, sewing, billiards, or whatever. In fact, it’s better if you find a niche that isn’t in the online marketing arena because that’s what nearly everyone else is doing. Make your topic unique. Make it yours. And make it your passion. It will pay you well."},{title:"Apple Iwork 08 Review",body:"The $79 iWork ’08 appears to be a good deal for anyone needing an affordable office suite for the Mac. Apple has finally added a spreadsheet application. At first glance, Numbers is an elegant no-brainer for anyone migrating from Microsoft Excel. In the past, many Mac aficionados bought Microsoft Excel because iWork lacked a spreadsheet application. However, with the addition of Numbers and the release of Microsoft’s Office for Mac 2008 delayed until January, Mac users may stick to Apple’s less expensive option. We’re also happy that Mac hasn’t changed its file formats as Microsoft did with Office 2007. We like the sparse interfaces throughout the iWork package. Its features aren’t as deep or rich as in Microsoft Office 2007, but iWork also hasn’t changed radically from its last incarnation, unlike Office. iWork also covers much more than just the basic productivity tasks offered by online tools like Google Docs & Spreadsheets or the Zoho suite, so it should be adequate for the vast majority of home and small-business users. System requirements, thankfully, are gentle to users of older Macs. You’ll need an Intel, PowerPC G5 or G4 machine with a 500MHz or better processor in addition to 512MB of RAM minimum, running OS X10.4.10. Pages Apple tore a page out of Microsoft Office’s book by creating a Contextual Format Bar that displays different features according to your task at hand. Select text, and the bar shows font options. Click on a picture, and the bar displays image-editing features. Unlike the contextual formatting Ribbon interface within Microsoft Word 2007, however, Pages offers no live previews of font and image changes as you hover over them. Pages ’08 also adds Change Tracking, similar to the Track Changes feature adopted many years ago by Microsoft Word. We’re glad that Pages gets this treatment for displaying document revisions rather than the often confusing revision and commenting history offered by the online Google Docs. Pages includes the usual must-have features for writers such as footnotes, bookmarks, and tables of content, in addition to integration with charts and functions from the new Numbers app. In addition, Pages now detects when you type a list and formats bulleted points automatically. We just hope that this won’t drive us batty (as it does sometimes in Microsoft Word). There are plenty of page templates for letters, resumes, reports, and the like to get started if a blank slate poses too much pressure. Page Layout mode lets you create relatively complex designs without software such as Adobe InDesign, great if you’re throwing together reports for work. It lets you layer images on top of images too. The Instant Alpha feature, also found in Keynote, lets you cut out backgrounds in images without dealing with alpha channels, a la Photoshop. And we prefer Pages’ color wheel, crayons, and spectrum to Word’s color options. Keynote Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 may be richer, but Apple Keynote ’08 adds some smart features that PowerPoint lacks. It’s also a breeze to figure out from the get-go. Action Builds let you create basic point-A-to-B motion animation, without needing to deal with motion tweens as in complex apps such as Adobe Flash. Smart Builds enable animation, such as rotating photographs, using images you can grab from the iLife media browser. And new voiceover recordings enable you, say, to narrate podcasts with pictures. There are new between-slide transitions and slide show themes too. Numbers Our early look at the new Numbers reveals ease of use novelties that competitive tools don’t provide. Microsoft Excel 2007 still appears to be more robust, particularly for number crunchers such as scientists, accountants, or engineers. Yet the majority of users who rely upon spreadsheets as one-size-fits-all tools for household and light office work should be pleased to have a new option for Macs. Numbers comes with plenty of templates, including travel planners, business expenses, and school science lab reports. Of course, it can also save and export Excel-readable files. This application pleases the eye and can make attractive spreadsheets. We dragged around text boxes, images, and tables using alignment guides without a hitch. You can add 3D bar, pie, and other charts and even integrate maps into a spreadsheet. The controls for working with tables were extremely user-friendly in our early tests. Slider bars allow you to adjust the numeric values within cells, handy if you’re looking to add a range of values. Resizing columns and rows appears to be less of a hassle than with Excel. You can drag data from a file of contacts or into a Numbers table that will automatically partition information into the appropriate columns. And sorting a table smartly leaves the headers alone. Formulas appear to be the same as those in Microsoft Excel, but Numbers also has easy-to-find natural language shortcuts for common calculations, such as sums and averages. The Interactive Print View offers more controls than in Microsoft Excel, which easily leads to unwieldy spreadsheet printouts. Numbers shows where a stray column might take up an unnecessary extra page. You can eliminate the overlap with a slider bar that instantly scales the tables, charts, and images on a page."},{title:"Make Myspace Your Best Designed Space",body:"The Myspace page defines the individual, his or her characteristics, traits, personal choices and the overall personality of the person. The page also has a number of identity related issues that can be linked on the Internet to get connected to people of common interest and issues. They can be preferred forms such as hobbies, interests and common issues followed by the people in the general. People connect to each other on the Internet using the myspace profile. But how does on improve the profile on the Internet using the tools and design aspects? It depends on the background employed by the user of the account. The background conveys many things to the visitors of the page. The background therefore should be carefully chosen. Preset templates are available in the myspace page for users to adopt them on their web page. However, users can also design the pages on their own using the tools available on the desktop. If the necessary tools are not available on the desktop, they can be accessed on the Internet by visiting certain sites that help build the myspace web page.\n\nThe backgrounds come in various colors and formats. They can be traced on the Internet. Use the search engines to find popular links to site providing backgrounds. There are two types of resources that provide the backgrounds. While the first category provides the backgrounds for free, the second category provides license-based backgrounds against payment of a fee. The first category of the free backgrounds has plenty of options, but the number of backgrounds is limited to a few hundreds. The colors are preset in the free backgrounds. There are very limited options for the user to make alterations in the web pages since they are in the form of templates. Besides, the templates of the backgrounds are protected by software codes. Unlocking these codes is a critical task for the users. Besides, people without technical background should not to try to break the codes. It is a very difficult task and attempting to break the codes to alter the backgrounds is not entertained. Therefore, the users’ choice is narrowed down to using them merely as templates for the background. The background can be used to decorate the Myspace page with a number of added features.\n\nHowever, if you find the free backgrounds not too attractive or flexible for use on the Myspace page, you can opt for license-based paid backgrounds. There are plenty of options available under the license-based web backgrounds. They can be hired for a year on a long license. Normally, the fee paid is nominal and the features are a plenty. Therefore, going in for a fee-based background is better.\n\nIn a fee-based background, there is a lot scope for experimenting with the properties. For instance, the icons or programs can be placed according to the wishes of the account holder. The icons can also be changed on a daily basis. You can also opt for a background that changes color every five minutes. There are plenty of options like these."

It’s pretty cool to download things from Itunes, but with a little research you can find thousands of other places to download from -check out our tips below to help you find out where.\n\nThe Iphone is staggeringly popular, although it hasn’t really come as much of a surprise – you only have to consider the Ipod as proof of Apple’s dominance with such gadgets. If you are lucky enough to be one of the early Iphone owners, check out these resources to help you get some free Iphone games.\n\n1-It’s one of the most obvious ways to find anything these days, but a simple google search can yield excellent results when you are looking for places to get your downloads. The downside of this is that after a little while you begin to realise that many of these sites have a few things in common. The trouble is that the sites that make themselves the most accessible in this way are the ones that are simply looking to make money with their advertising. They get paid for you to click on their ads, so it’s in their interest to drag as many visitors as possible into their site, and for this reason you’ll find that many of them offer no real downloads at all.\n\n2-There is a slight variation on the sites above, in that they will offer a couple of Iphone downloads, whether they be games or movies or wallpapers or whatever, but they will be very old and dated, and in many cases once you complete the download you’ll find it doesn’t work anyway. The point of this is, you guessed it, just to attract visitors who may then click on the advertising and make some money. Not exactly a noble business model, but I guess it works as there seem to be enough sites like that around!\n\n3-The most obvious place for you to look when downloading just about anything these days is the torrent sites, peer to peer sites, or file sharing sites, or whatever they are called this week. I’m sure you know the ones-huge download collections, completely illegal to use, and yet it seems like everyone knows someone who has gone download crazy and downloaded huge amounts of things from there. Avoid these sites like the plague. It’s illegal to use them in most places, and also there are usually a fair amount of viruses etc to be found within their databases. Not cool!\n\n4-Your best bet for free Iphone game downloads, and just about anything else for the Iphone is the newer type of download site. A few of these popped up a while back for the Ipod, and it seems like they are following the trend with the Iphone. Basically, they work by charging and admin fee up front, and once you pay that you then have access to their whole download database. Not just Iphone games either, you’ll find movies, games, tv shows, music videos and all kinds of stuff. Think of it like a version of Itunes where you pay one flat fee. Using sites like this usually works out far cheaper than something like Itunes in the long run.\n\nGetting free Iphone games and other downloads can seem like a very far fetched idea, that is until you find the right places. Hopefully this article has helped you know where to look. Happy downloading!"},{title:"Maintain Your Pc S Performance With Pc Programs",body:"Over time, even the most sophisticated, memory packed computer can begin to run slow if we don’t do something to prevent it. The reason why has less to do with how computers are made and how they age and more to do with the way we use them. You see, all of the daily tasks that we do on our PC from running programs to downloading and deleting software can make our computer sluggish. To keep this from happening, you need to understand the reasons why your PC is getting slower and do something to keep your PC running at its best. You can do this through regular maintenance and PC performance optimization programs.\n\nBefore we discuss all of the things that could be affecting your PC’s performance, let’s talk a little about what symptoms a slow computer can have. In addition to being excruciatingly slow when it comes to opening programs or finishing tasks, your PC may also experience data loss, unwanted shutdowns, Windows crashing and Windows hang up. All of these can be very annoying to deal with and are a sure sign that you need to optimize your PC and maintain it. There are many reasons why your PC is getting slower and not performing quite the way it used to. Any one of them may be just the thing that is holding your PC back. In some cases, there is more than one culprit at work. But there are solutions to keep your computer from being affected by these nuisances, and we will talk about what you can do to maintain your PC and keep it running smoothly if it encounters any of these problems.\n\nWhen you download and use programs on your PC, sometimes they are set up to start running as soon as you turn on your computer. These programs may be running in the background without you even knowing it and they use up precious memory needed for other tasks. To see if you have any programs running in the background, press Ctrl + Alt + Delete at the same time.\n\nA list of all of the currently running programs will appear in a pop up window. You can choose to stop the programs by highlighting the program and clicking “end task.” If you want to keep those programs from starting when you turn on your PC, change the individual settings for each program so that they will not automatically be turned on.\n\nMemory is a computer component that allows it to do all of the various tasks that you require of it. When you start to do a task, a segment of memory is assigned to that task. If you don’t have enough memory and you try to do several tasks at once, you may run out of memory and not be able to perform any tasks properly. In order to optimize and maintain memory, you can use a Memory Optimizer program. This program changes the way that Windows manages memory so that you can use it more efficiently. Your hard drive is like a huge filing cabinet containing all of the files that you need for your computer to perform properly. When you add programs, files are added to this data base. When you delete data or programs, files are removed. This process results in holes or empty spaces in your filing cabinet. These holes make it harder for your computer to work because it continuously has to search for information over a larger distance and sometimes search for information that is completely out of order. To combat this, you need to defragment your hard drive. You can do this with your Windows system optimization tools or with a Registry Deffrager and Optimizer. These programs eliminate holes and arrange your files in a sensible order. Just as your PC’s hard drive could be filed improperly, it can also be too full to work at its best. A good rule of thumb is to have at least 2MB to 3MB of space on your hard drive for your PC to function properly. To free up space, simply delete unused programs on the C: drive. Maintaining your PC’s performance is vital if you want you computer to always complete tasks at its top speed. While Windows has some system tools to help you do this, they do not work on their own. You have to actually go and start the programs to optimize your computer. And they may not be enough. In this case, you may want to opt for optimization software such as PC Programs to help maintain your PC’s performance."},{title:"Thousands Now Adware Removal Who Never Thought They Could",body:"The first is a non technical method which requires the use of adware removal software.

You may see some for as low as $.17 each. You may be saying to yourself, “Wow, what a deal!”. But be careful, check out the quality before you make your purchase. Make sure the tape will fit your needs.\n\nIf you are using your cassette tapes to record something fast, and the life of the cassette will be short, then maybe the cheap ones are for you. However, if you need a quality recording, or are looking to keep that cassette for some time, then you will need to be prepared to pay a little more. The quality you receive will be well worth the added cost.\n\nSpoken word applications are one use that requires a higher quality cassette. Going with cheap blank cassettes will certainly result in poor quality originals and duplicates. If you are involved in recording speeches, sermons, lectures, audio books or teaching tapes, then you will find the points below of great interest. So what are some of the differences, and what should you be looking for? The following is a list of suggestions on the type of tapes to use:\n\n1. The cassette shell should be held together with a five-screw design. This type of design will help to keep the shell from warping. If the shell warps, the tape will not be able to move smoothly for good recording or playback. It may not be able to move at all. The five-screw design also allows the cassette to be taken apart if necessary. So, if the shell got damaged, the tape could be moved to a different shell, for continued use. 2. Using Type I tape is sufficient for spoken word applications. You still need to make sure that the tape is of good quality. Poor quality tape will result in a poor quality recording. It can even cause undue wear on copiers, and more frequent cleaning of the copier heads.\n\n3. Make sure that the felt pad that presses the tape against the head is sufficient. The larger the pad the better the tape to head contact allowing for better quality recording. Even a slight separation between the tape and the head will result in a poor recording.\n\n4. Pins and rollers are also important. The rollers are what guide the tape around the corners of the cassette. The pins hold the rollers in place. Some manufacturers will use plastic pins. This has the potential of the roller and the pin becoming welded under heated conditions. Also, if the rollers are of cheap quality, the tape may not move smoothly while recording or copying. The tape can even become damaged due to friction. \n\n5. Slip sheets are the sleeves between the tape and the case. These are also important since they help the tape to travel smoother. Smooth travel of the tape is critical to a good recording.\n\nAs you can see from just a brief description, all blank cassettes are not created equal. There can be a huge difference between them, and the quality of recording that will result. If the recording quality and longevity is critical to you, then you’ll be glad you paid the extra for a better blank cassette."},{title:"How Plasma Tvs And Lcd Tvs Differ",body:"The buying of large-screen TVs has absolutely skyrocketed lately. It seems that everyone wants one – and with good reason. The large-screen TV has come a long way from those faded-out behemoths of old that took up half your living room and never really produced a picture of decent quality. Now, however, especially in combination with HDTV, you can get not only a nice, large picture, but a crisp, clean one too.\n\nOnce you decide that you’re ready for a large-screen TV, you quickly discover that you only really have two main options – a plasma TV or an LCD TV. Plasma TVs were first on the scene, but the recent mass production of LCD TVs by major manufactures has put LCD TVs pretty much on equal footing with plasmas. That said, you will still have to make a choice.\n\nIf you’re like most people, you not only have no idea how the two differ, you don’t even know the areas you should be considering in order to determine how they differ. But they do indeed differ, and knowing the difference is extremely important if you’re going to get the TV that’s right for you.\n\nYou can essentially boil the differences between plasmas and LCDs into twelve basic points. In some areas, plasmas will win out. In other areas, LCDs will win out. In yet other areas, it will depend on your own personal taste in order to decide who wins out.\n\nThe twelve ways plasma TVs and LCD TVs differ are the following:\n\n1. The first is a technical issue, and may seem a little boring, but it really does affect other areas. Plasmas TVs are made of chemical compounds called phosphors. LCD TVs use millions of liquid crystals.\n\n2. The next section is related to how big the TVs are and the availability of larger sizes. You have a wider selection of larger-size TVs with plasmas (though LCDs are catching up).\n\n3. The next section is “small size,” which is also important. Plasmas don’t come in smaller sizes, which you will need for places like the kitchen.\n\n4. Next is viewing angle. Plasmas tend to have a wider viewing angle (though, again, LCDs are catching up).\n\n5. Although the manufacturers may not like to admit it, each “can” suffer from certain problems. Plasmas can suffer from burn-in effect; LCDs don’t.\n\n6. Another problem area, but for LCDs, is “delay.” LCDs can produce a jagged figure when in motion. Plasmas tend to do better. HDTV improves this dramatically for both.\n\n7. The next area is life span. You can replace the light source with an LCD, thereby bringing your original picture back. With plasmas you can’t.\n\n8. In the next few sections, the theme of “picture quality” is considered. First, color: LCDs produce sharp, lively colors. Plasmas produce warmer and more accurate colors.\n\n9. Next is brightness levels and the TVs ability to handle different lighting. LCDs tend to do better in bright-light conditions.\n\n10. Also related to picture quality is “black levels.” Plasmas tend to produce blacker blacks.\n\n11. Another area to consider is contrast range. Plasmas, “technically,” produce a higher contrast range.\n\n12. Last, and certainly not least, is price. At the moment, plasmas tend to run a little cheaper, but this is changing rapidly as LCDs flood into the market. By the time you read this, in fact, there may be no difference at all.\n\nEssentially, which one is right for you will all comes down to taste: What potential negatives will you not really notice? What positives do you want more of? What do you really want the TV for – movies, sports, news, regular TV shows? Both plasmas and LCDs have strong advocates in their corners. Both have deliriously happy customers. But those happy customers are only happy because they knew what they wanted before they made their purchase. If you want to make the right choice, you’ll have to decide what it is you want and which of the two TVs can best give you that."},{title:"Protective Preventative Maintenance",body:"You have just invested in a new vehicle, the one of your dreams, and you take it on a trip across Canada.

Besides being a true poker genius and a three time World Series of Poker champion, Stu Unger had a fascinating life story. It was not surprising that after his death Stu was the subject of a biography and a biopic. Stu Unger lived the life of a rock star including the quick rise to fame, the drugs, the comeback and the unavoidable death at an early age. Here you can read about the life story of the legendary poker player Stu Unger. The Beginning\n\nStuart Errol Ungar was born in 1953 to a Jewish family who lived in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. Stus father was a well known bookmaker and his mother was too ill to fight against her sons fascination with gambling. After the death of his father, 13 years old Stu had found a father figure at his neighbor Victor Romano, one of the infamous Genovese family soldiers. Stu and Romano had at least one thing in common: they both had an incredibly sharp memory, which was mainly used in poker and gin games. By that time, Stu was already an accomplished gin player who had gained vast experience in winning gin tournaments. Stu dropped out of school to become a full time gin rummy player. The Genovese family had benefited from Stus talent. In return, they provided him protection from other gamblers who found themselves offended by his harsh and arrogant playing style. \n\nThe Rise\n\nAs a professional gin player, Stu had managed to beat all the professional gin poker players around. According to the rumors, Stu caused Harry Yonkie Stein, one of the best players around to stop playing gin completely after beating him in a gin match. Since he was out of proper competition, Stu decided to focus on playing poker professionally. In 1976, he and his girlfriend relocated to Las Vegas where they got married and had a girl, Stephanie. In 1980, Stu won the World Series of Poker Main Event after beating experienced poker pros such as Doyle Bronson. Stu was the youngest WSOP champion in history and was nicknamed The Kid. Even though Stu won the 1981 WSOP Main Event, he still considered himself more a gin and rummy player than a poker player. After winning his first WSOP championship title, he was quoted saying that the poker world would meet better no limit players than him, but no one will ever be able to play gin rummy better than he does. At the same time, Stu had tried to use his skill to grab money at the blackjack table. Nevertheless, the casinos were not happy with Stus presence around the blackjack tables and he was constantly barred. In 1982, he was fined by the New Jersey Gaming Commission for cheating, although Stu has not done anything illegal but using his natural skill and phenomenal memory. The Fall\n\nIn 1990, Stu made another appearance to the WSOP. This time, he was heavily into drugs. He was a chip leader for the first three days of the event and then disappeared. He was found lying at his hotel room, unconscious from a drug overdose. However, it did not stop him from finishing ninth and earning enough money for his future cocaine supply. The Comeback\n\nAfter seven years of disappearing from the professional poker circle, Stu had returned to the WSOP. In 1997, he was broke, with damaged nostrils from cocaine abuse, addicted to horseracing and sports gambling, but still in shape to beat all the new contestants and gain back his WSOP Championship title. The local media was happy to embrace The Comeback Kid, but his success did not last long.\n\nThe Death\n\nStu Unger did not attend the 1998 World Series of Poker since he could not get the money to pay the entry fee. Seven months after Scotty Nguyen won the 1998 WSOP, Stu Ungar was found dead at his motel room in Las Vegas with 800 dollars in his pocket. Apparently, he died of a heart condition caused by years of drug abuse.

While all of them have similar features, it is better to be aware of certain key features that determines their price and print quality. First to look out for is the printing width. It differs among printers. Normally they are available with a width of either 8.5 inches or 13 inches.

You must also look for the printing speed per minute. Generally it takes up to 10 minutes for one color photo so you must factor it in when choosing the model. When you want to buy multi use printers, please note that for good quality photo printing you need to buy a dedicated printer or a digital photo printer that accepts the most popular memory cards.\n\nNow let us see the top 5 best photo printers and some of their features:\n\nEpson Stylus Pro 4000 can take in paper wider than 11 inches thus making it very convenient. The high quality color and grayscale printing and the ability to make use of rolls of paper instead of sheets make it very economical too.\n\nCanon Pixma IP8500 Photo Printer is another best photo printer in our top 5 list. It scores very high on speed, color and print quality. Almost all users love the 8 color cartridges. One disadvantage is the absence of media card slot – simply unacceptable in a high-end printer. The built in duplexer and good text printing however makes up for this disadvantage as it could be used for general and business use as well.\n\nCanon Slephy DS700 is the best photo printer in the portable category. It plugs in directly into your TV so you could examine your photos in detail before printing them without having to transfer them to a PC.\n\nThe ever popular Epson Picture Mate is another best seller in its newest version – The Epson Picture Mate Deluxe. Though it has many added features and higher speeds, it no longer seem to have the cost-effectiveness per print of the older model.\n\nAnother best photo printer worth considering is the Sony PictureStation DPP-FP30. the installation is simple and the quality is simply Sony standards. However a small problem is the high running costs.\n\nSo have fun with the best photo printer that you have selected and may your photo memories come alive as good photo prints too!"},{title:"Steps In Installing Rack Mount Lcd Monitors",body:"Rack mount LCD monitors can save you a lot of space and help you form a convenient and efficient desktop for your work or home study.

As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online casinos.\n\nThe Payment Systems You Can Use:\n\n1, 2) MasterCard and Visa:\n\nThe most popular credit cards in the world, you can use these for depositing money into your casino account. But, please note that the casinos do not deposit your winning through your credit card. They use one of the other electronic payment systems. This is also the biggest reason why you should refrain from using your personal credit cards today for gambling.\n\n3, 4) Visa Delta, Visa Electron:\n\nThese are debit cards that one can use to deposit cash into their casino account. By debit card, it means that the money you pay through the card, is immediately withdrawn from your bank account. This is a comfortable option, but here too, you cannot receive money into it.\n\n5) Neteller:\n\nBased in the UK and traded on the London AIM Stock Exchange, this e-bank company is one of the major independent electronic banking entities in the world, and it allows players to transfer money to and from an online casino.\n\n6) Neteller Instacash\n\nThis is Neteller’s version of the Debit Card, and, in fact, it is just like any other debit card with one difference. To use, InstaCash, you have to pay a small amount. But, most casinos will offer to pay this for you, so read their regulations.\n\n7) EcoCard\n\nBased in the European Union, EcoCard offers a wider range of electronic banking solutions than the other e-banks. Other than the regular card and debit system, you can decide beforehand how to create a flexible financial account. Because they use a wide network of banks in Europe, transactions made through EcoCard are quick and efficient.\n\n8) FirePay\n\nThis e-banking system is solely web-based and carries out its transactions just like a debit card. You place cash into your FirePay account, and then, you can use that money to pay or deposit into your casino account. While it will not cost you a dime to open an account, you will be charged a minimal amount each time you transfer money from your bank account to FirePay.\n\n9) Moneybookers\n\nAll you need to open an account is an email address! This e-banking system uses transactions from your credit or debit card or your bank account to whichever company you wish to move your money to. Regulated in the UK and run by Gatcombe Park Ventures Limited, this is one of the relatively new e-finance companies that allow transferring money to online casinos.\n\n10) eWalletXpress:\n\nOwned and run by Navaho Networks Inc, eWalletXpress is a new electronic payment system that has been created to answer the need for US players to transfer funds to online casinos.

Don’t beat around the bush.\n\n3.Don’t be arrogant – You are calling technical support because you need help.

It’s hard for someone to help you through a problem if don’t have access to the computer. 6.Record the error – If you are calling about an error you saw, make sure you write it down.

These are not meant to make you angry, they help in the process of solving your problem.\n\n9.Know what kind of support is offered – Ask around the office before calling to see what kind of support is offered. Not all technical support centers offer “How to” help. If your support group does not offer this type of support you may have to get a coworker to help.\n\n10.*The Golden Rule*: Technical support is trying to help – The reason you called, in the first place, is because you needed help with something. Try not to make it difficult for the person on the other end to help you. These tips aren’t just some random bunch of words I have put together. I am one of the people you get on the phone when you call technical support.

Try and treat them as you would want to be treated and I guarantee your next experience will be much better."},{title:"Converter Ipod Video Taking Portable Video Viewing To A Whole New Level",body:"All the rumors have finally died down and many skeptics have tightened their lips, the iPod does support video format now on its fifth generation.

Online education is generally taught through the use of several different methods, including online satellite feeds, correspondence or online lessons. This technique permits the student to obtain a DVD repair degree without ever having to step inside of a classroom. An online education, providing that it is granted by a regionally accredited college or university, is broadly accepted as worthy training for any job in the direct field of study.\n\nOnline education is approachable in many ways, but students often neglect the fact that it is much more economical than a traditional campus degree. Why? When factoring in the costs associated with student housing & meals, which often begins at a total of $6,000 or more every year, the savings are evident. With an online DVD repair education, students pay only for the courses that they are taking and they often choose to do so on a per credit hour basis rather than paying the full tuition each year.\n\nThe type of distance education degree that everyone should abstain from is what is known as a ‘diploma mill.’ In exchange for a specified sum of money, which is often $1,000.00 or more, they will issue a life experience degree with little or no investigation into the applicant’s background. These businesses often feature a very professionally designed website and appear to be very much legitimate. In fact, they even guarantee potential students that they are issuing legal degrees. Upon further examination of these so-called colleges, students will learn that they can even purchase a transcript with any letter grade that they choose. But, what is the basis for the grade? No classes were ever required, no tests taken and no valid grades were issued. Individuals who are interested in earning a legitimate degree should be very wary of any college or institution that offers to provide a life experience degree based only on the word of applicant and does little, or no, investigation into the student’s background.\n\nThe truth is that the only actual way to receive life experience credit is to take the CLEP test, which is given periodically at local colleges and universities. In addition, a number of universities are willing to accept portfolio assessments in exchange for possible life experience credit. These are legitimate ways to earn life experience, or knowledge-based, DVD repair college credit."},{title:"Guidelines For Inkjet Cartridge Refill",body:"There are number of instructions to be followed at the time of refilling an inkjet cartridge.

It was really cool looking (technologically speaking), and I was awfully proud to own it. It certainly made for lots of fun times.\n\nWhat was this high-tech gift, you ask? Why, it was a tape recorder! It was a monographic, reel to reel tape deck that came with it’s own plug-in microphone. I could hold that mic up to my transistor radio’s speaker and record songs onto tape. I could also play the guitar and sing and record every second of it. I could even hide and record conversations from unsuspecting family members. I was in recording heaven!\n\nYears later I owned an 8 track stereo recording deck (ok, that was a mistake). At another point in time I had a stereo cassette recording deck that would physically flip the tape over when one side was finished recording or playing. Now I own a more conventional stereo dual cassette deck, but I no longer use it for recording or much of anything else for that matter.\n\nAll my recording is now done on my computer. The audio and midi software available today for computer recording is quite amazing. You can record multiple tracks, edit the recordings and add special effects as desired. Many of the audio recording programs come with their own native special effects such as reverb, compression, flanger, and chorus, to name a few. Some of the recording software can also accept third party effects such as vocal removers, tube amp effects and many more.\n\nMultitrack recording software allows for recording various live instruments, vocals, etc, onto individual tracks. After recording one track, you can play it back while recording another. Once finished, you can mix all the individual tracks down into one stereo track. Some recording software will import and record both audio and MIDI, some audio only. If you have a MIDI keyboard or other MIDI instrument, be sure to pick software that handles both formats.\n\nCreating a simple home audio recording studio is easy. In addition to software, an audio and/or midi interface will allow you to plug all kinds of audio components, microphones and instruments into your computer for live recording, recording from tape or even from your old vinyl lp’s. You can also use a home stereo system as an interface for audio components by running cables to it from your computer’s sound card. A laptop with recording software and a USB interface can serve as a totally portable recording studio. And again, if you have MIDI instruments, be sure to get an interface that will allow connecting them in additon to audio components and instruments.\n\nThe digital revolution has made music recording easily available to anyone with a computer. If you enjoy music and want to do more than just download mp3’s from the Internet, get some multitrack recording software and start your own home sound studio."},{title:"5 Tips For Offshore Software Development",body:"As a business owner or manager, the decision to opt for offshore software development can be difficult. As anyone who has experience knows, there are advantages and disadvantages to outsourcing software development. How then, do you balance the risks and rewards and come out on top? Here are five tips to ensure that you receive an excellent return on investment:\n\n1. Complex project management experience. When selecting an offshore software development company, ensure that they have extensive experience in complex project management. The company’s internal team should run like a well-oiled machine, and they should have longstanding relationships with their own subcontractors. 2. Specialized knowledge and expertise. The most agile software development companies have an extensive network of specialists. These specialists may not be on the company payroll (which is why the company can offer you significant cost savings), but they can be depended upon to complete the necessary tasks on time and within the budget. 3. Knowledge of your industry. In theory, offshore software development companies should be able to perform custom software development for any type of business. There will be less of a learning curve, though, and greater chances for success, if the company has knowledge of your industry or a related industry. For this reason, ask for referrals and determine if the projects the company has managed are similar to or in alignment with the goals of your project.\n\n4. Delineate areas of responsibility. Chances are, you’re considering hiring an offshore software development company because you don’t have the in-house expertise to get the job done and know that it is more cost-effective to outsource the project. Nonetheless, you will need to actively participate in a needs assessment and at various benchmarks throughout the life of the project. By creating a clear delineation of areas of responsibility, you will have a clear understanding of the number of staff hours you need to devote to the project, and plan accordingly. 5. High standards. Both you and the offshore software development company you choose should adhere to high standards. Aside from the talent of the technical experts involved, successful custom software development depends upon rigorous testing. The most dependable companies use the highest industry standards in testing each aspect of the products they create so that you receive a product that is ready to implement. Essentially, the most successful offshore software development companies are competent and flexible, and see their role as an information technology partner who solves your software problems, supports your team, and manages your projects from beginning to end. When you choose such a company, you can rest assured that you will receive an excellent return on investment."},{title:"How To Put Movies On Iphone",body:"If you own an Iphone, you’ve probably already worked out how much fun it is to use it to watch movies-it has that nice big screen, and the sound quality is surprisingly good too.

Small businesses often can’t afford to have that sort of internal support in place, yet they need fully operational IT systems in order for the business to run properly. For businesses like these, external IT support can be a cost-effective yet vital resource.\n\n1. Avoid IT salary bills\n\nEven one experienced, trained IT professional can cost a lot of money. Paying a salary, tax, National Insurance, pension and any other benefits can make a big difference to your bottom line. For small businesses, there just isn’t enough IT requirement to justify employing someone to run the system full-time. Instead, put your money towards your business, and pay a lot less for an external IT professional to help you when you need it.\n\n2. Online and telephone support\n\nIf you haven’t got support in the office, you need to know that there’s someone on the end of the phone that can help with any IT problems that arise. Most IT support firms offer phone and online support and, because many problems can be sorted out over the phone, you won’t have to wait for an engineer to come out to your office.\n\n3. Security\n\nSome of the most important parts of your IT system are the ones that protect you from fraud, virus or other harm. Any software that’s protecting your system needs checking and updating on a regular basis, to make sure that your business is secure. Rather than scheduling this in for someone in your office to do, it’s much easier to arrange for an external IT company to come in to your office on an agreed timetable to keep your IT security up-to-date.\n\nUsing IT support has many benefits, but for small businesses, the most important thing is that external IT support allows you to concentrate on your business, whilst retaining confidence in your IT systems – and at a much lower cost than employing your own IT expert."},{title:"Are You Ready To Buy A Home Theater Audio System",body:"Are you ready to buy a home theater audio system? Here are several tips to help you find the right audio system for you.\n\n1. Spend some quality time with the room you are going to put your new home theater audio system. Believe it or not but the room is as much a component in your home theater system as any of the electronics you will ever buy. Ask yourself which room you will be putting your new system in. Consider whether or not this room is going to be used solely for you system or will it be used for other activities. Will there be any size considerations for the components and speakers you plan on using with the dimensions of the room?\n\nConsider drawing a map of your room and sketch the possible placements of your furniture, components and speakers. Measure the room’s dimensions and write them down. Make a list of all the inputs you currently have and will continue to use. Make a list of the inputs you intend to add to your new audio system. You should write down which components are going to need cables and wires. Also, write down the approximate lengths of those cables and wires. Once all of this is worked out carry this information and map with you when you go out to buy your new audio system.\n\nIt is important to arrange your room for optimal picture and sound by reducing screen and hard surface reflections. Do not forget the TV picture is not very pretty when light is reflecting off the screen. Also, audio is not so wonderful when sound waves are reflecting off hard surfaces like bare walls and windows.\n\n2. Decide on what you want to experience when you settle down on your couch with your partner and a big bowl of popcorn. Ruminate on the experience you want before you ruminate on your budget. Is it stereo, surround sound, or primarily movies?\n\n3. Spend a few hours looking around on key sites and forums and you will know more than most. Friends, family, trade and consumer magazines and inquiring jaunts to your favorite electronic store will help you gain customer leverage. Do not buy anything at this point. Get as much information stuffed into your brain that will help you when the time comes for you to buy your system.\n\n4. Revisit the drawing of your room and your research.

Modern advances with the LCD computer monitors have changed a lot of that. The screen itself is flat, and very thin, needing very little desktop space, therefore giving you more room while working at your PC. A big advantage in my opinion is that LCD monitors don’t put off all the heat that the old monitors do. Those old monitors could quickly heat up a room, especially if you have more than one in the same space. LCD monitors require very little energy, making your wallet a little fatter by avoiding high energy bills. LCD monitors also reduce the glare, making them a better choice for gamers, and anyone who spends a lot of time in front of their computer.\n\nA big problem with the old monitors, other than the obvious, is that if you forget to use a screensaver, images left on the screen will actually burn into the screen, which can affect picture quality, not to mention the fact that screensavers are just flat out annoying.\n\nLCD monitors also tend to be less expensive on repair costs as well. They have less parts inside them to break, therefore saving you money in the event of a problem. Many people who have CRT monitors will just opt to buy a new monitor when something goes wrong, because it is often cheaper than trying to repair the problem, again saving you money.\n\nAs with any major purchase, it is important to do some research and shop around before making a final selection. Many people are often thrown off by the price of LCD monitors, but they are a good investment in the long haul of things. The good thing is that LCD monitors are quickly gaining popularity, so dealers have to work harder to keep their prices competitive, which puts the consumer at an advantage. Before going shopping, you should decide what type/brand of LCD monitor you need, and know the average cost of that particular monitor, so that you can get the best overall deal. You should also have in mind what size monitor will best suit your needs, which will narrow down your search once you are actually at the store to make your purchase.\n\nPurchasing any kind of new technological gadgetry can be a daunting task, but if you arm yourself first with good research and planning, purchasing an LCD monitor should be an easy decision. If you spend as much time in front a computer screen as most people do, an average of 3 hours a day or more, you will be thankful that you made the decision to purchase an LCD monitor."},{title:"Compare Prices Find The Best Computer Accessory",body:"Accessories Here you can find the best computer accessory for your laptop, monitor, printer, scanner, speaker, projector, hardware and more. laptop accessory compaq laptop battery compaq laptop battery charger compaq laptop computer … Large main compartment features a padded laptop computer pocket, accessory pockets, mesh disk pockets, and ample room for business papers.

},{title:"A Discount Toner Cartridge Is Better Than Ever And You Will Save 50 Or More",body:"Having used discount toner cartridges for twenty years, there have been a lot of changes in the toner cartridge market. The market today is approximately a twenty billion dollar business. The savings today are significant. The quality of the discount cartridges is unsurpassed. To insure your complete satisfaction in purchasing discount toner, take a minute to make an informed choice.\n\nDiscount toner cartridges were originally sold as recycled toner cartridges. The basic recycling method consisted of drilling a hole in the cartridge and refilling it with toner. Once the cartridge was filled, the hole was plugged. This toner cartridge was then sold to the consumer as a great deal or a “discount toner cartridge”.\n\nThe problem was that the drill and fill cartridges produced poor quality and printed fewer pages. They were very inconsistent from cartridge to cartridge. In short, there was no quality control. One discount toner cartridge might perform great and the next may not.\n\nHowever, things have changed significantly. Today, discount toner cartridges are brand new cartridges made from brand new parts… the same parts specified in your OEM printer manual. The technology is the same as that used by major printer manufacturers. Today, a reputable discount toner company uses the same components as major printer companies. Their toner, drums and rollers are the same quality and specification.\n\nKnow What Type of Toner Cartridge You Are Purchasing\n\nDiscount toner cartridges sometimes has a dual meaning. When some companies use the term discount toner cartridge, they really mean “remanufactured” toner cartridges. When other companies use the term discount toner cartridge, they mean a “new” toner cartridge manufactured by a third party merchant. Both types of cartridges could be a good buy.\n\nLearn About the Toner Company\n\nBe sure you learn about the company you buy toner from. All companies are not the same. Remember, a remanufactured toner cartridge can be as good of quality as a new discount toner cartridge. Both types of toner cartridges will save you a significant amount of money.\n\nThe best suppliers of discount toner cartridges have a quality control process in place. They insure that their toner cartridges are checked and double-checked so that you get high quality printing and the same number of pages or more. If a cartridge is remanufactured, any parts that do not meet their standards are replaced. You should be satisfied with the first and last page of printing.\n\nYou may not know everything about a printer company before you purchase, but you can find out exactly what type of discount toner cartridge you are buying. Look at our section on purchasing discount toner cartridges online. This will give you some basic information on what to look for in a toner cartridge merchant. Good companies offer good warranties. You should always get a strong money back guarantee. If a company does not warranty their toner cartridges for one year, you haven’t found the right company.\n\nDo your homework. Visit the websites of several reputable toner companies. Find your exact toner cartridge. Compare prices, warranties, shipping, service, etc. If you can talk with someone that has purchased from the company, do it. Once you’ve done your part, purchase a discount toner cartridge and test it out. Discount toner cartridges are better than ever and will reduce your printing cost by half or more."},{title:"Hotels How To Get Free Gifts",body:"Planning to visit Las Vegas or any other vacational resort where casinos are a major portion of their business? I have just the thing for you. Here, I will show you how to pass off as a High Roller and collect many complimentary items and gifts.\n\nWhat is the Secret?\n\nThe Secret is that you have to make them believe you are rich and love gambling. In short you have to impersonate a High Roller.  Why?\n\nHotels love high rollers because these players leave behind thousands of dollars each visit. And the real cool part about this is that if you act the role, casinos will lavish you with the same gifts and complimentary items that a real High Roller would receive.\n\nHow ?\n\nIt is not that difficult to fool the hotel and resorts with some finesse and true self-confidence. It can be done. 1) The Way you Dress: Elegant and smart is the way to go. Opt out of the baseball cap, t-shirt and jeans. Try and wear a suit or at least a regular buttoned shirt with an elegant dark jacket. It was Shakespeare who said that the clothes maketh a man, and so too, when going to a hotel resort. They judge you according to how you dress, so dress according to the role.\n\n2) A Large Pad of Notes:\n\nYes. Just like in the movies. Carry a large bundle of notes with you and keep them in plain sight. You do not have to really take with you that much. Instead, take a few notes and place them at the top and at the bottom of real note-size paper cuttings. Just remember to never expose this while you are in the casino. Use other notes you’re your wallet instead. But do it nonchalantly so that none of the casino personnel will notice.\n\n3) Always Flash Your Notes Around: No matter where you go, whether its to the hotel restaurant for lunch or for to the bar. They will be watching. From time to time, use that money to play at a range of table games or video game and bet some of that money. Remember you must use some of your money to play but just do not use all of it. 4) Play Complicated Games:\n\nThis is one of the more problematic things to do and requires some training at home. Learn on your own how to lay and how to bet on the high rolling games such as roulette, baccarat and craps. You could also play poker or Texas holdem in one of the larger ante tables, but in any case stick to your plan and you will soon reap the flowers. \n\nAbove, I have outlined some of the more practical methods by which one can save money by receiving gifts from the casino. These gifts range from casino comps (free money to play), room deals that can get nearly free and many others such as free drinks, clothes, coupon to stores in Las Vegas and many more. Note that what you are doing here is completely legal provided you don’t take up a false name or falsify your passport card."},{title:"Popular Uses Of The Internet",body:"Usage of the Internet is becoming more common due to rapid advancement of technology and the power of globalization. Societies are becoming more inter-connected. Thoughts from different cultures are shared through the use of Internet chat rooms and web postings. Study results also track the most popular uses of the Internet: “this year’s study shows that e-mail is the top task conducted online, followed by general surfing, reading News, shopping, and seeking entertainment News.” (Chang Joshua (2005)) It can be summarized that the Internet is now being used for common, everyday tasks that would have normally taken more time to complete. Internet shopping is becoming popular amongst users in developed nations, as it is more efficient to ‘shop on the Internet’ than to go physically into the stores. The Internet provides a virtual environment where consumers’ demands are met with supplies. For example, research has shown that shopping on the Internet can result in lower search costs and better product selections. This is because the shopper has the ability to analyze prices from various stores without having to travel distances. The shopper can now shop online for goods that are for sale in a foreign nation, and rather than having to travel to the country to receive the goods, the consumer can order online and get it delivered efficiently. According to the Ernst and Young Survey (‘Internet Shopping’ 1998), prospective shoppers viewed price savings and selection as more important benefits than convenience, which was ranked third. However, using the Internet we have the capacity to achieve both, having the ability to offer shoppers convenience as well as better prices.\n\nNot only has the Internet achieved a more equitable trading environment for consumers, it also gives us the potential to communicate more effectively and efficiently. For example, the cost of sending an email is generally cheaper than posting a letter in the mail, especially for people wishing to communicate internationally. Furthermore, an email can be sent immediately after it is written, and does not need to go through official procedures such as the Post Office and a mail box. The recipient of the email is able to access it from anywhere, as it is a virtual communication tool, as opposed to having a physical mail box where the letters are delivered. Thus, clearly, an Internet communication tool such as the Internet is extremely valuable, especially for travelers who need to be able to be interconnected with their ‘old’ lifestyle whilst journeying to experience foreign cultures. The power of the Internet not only extends to people who need the convenience of shopping, and to be able to easily communicate with associates and friends, but the Internet also provides an environment for News sharing and encourages people to be updated with the News. Unfortunately, as there currently isn’t any appropriate ‘virtual filtering system’ software out there, although there are many News articles available, they are from the perspective of international media institutions. However, the Internet is constantly changing and is becoming more accommodating to the individual as opposed to just catering to international corporations. Many academics believe that the Internet is a form of communication for people who want to express their own opinions and who don’t want to be repressed by the wealthy, whom are often seen as domineering as they hold too much power in a capitalist society. Furthermore, many teenagers would also confirm that they have had many positive experiences with the Internet as they believe it is a place for them to ‘escape’ from the pressures of reality and enjoy the entertainment that this system has the ability to provide. Computer games, although some would argue that they actually distract people from reality, provide the opportunity for individuals to express creativity and challenge themselves. Interactive computer games provide an environment where individuals are allowed to explore foreign surroundings and take risks that will result in no harm to the game player. The Internet appeals to the younger generation not only because of entertainment purposes, but young academics have also agreed that the Internet creates convenience to research and university students. This is because many different articles can be found on a specific topic, and not only is the opinions of academics read, but people with unique experiences and in different professions are also heard and critically analyzed. Being an academic myself, I strongly believe that the Internet provides a great environment where people are allowed to share their thoughts and beliefs whilst remaining anonymous. In conclusion, popular uses of the Internet have largely contributed to the advancement of society. More people are now turning to this phenomenon in order to have an efficient lifestyle where the maximum number of tasks can be achieved everyday. Although some would argue that people are becoming too reliant on the Internet, others would argue that it is a freedom of choice and it is the individuals’ choice to be able to choose how much they should be using the Internet per day, and on how dependent they want to be. Ultimately, the Internet is a tool that is effective when used appropriately and effectively and it is at the discretion of the individual. As quoted by Schipper, “the Internet is a tool that has both good and bad sides; let’s weed out the bad ones.”\n\nBibliography:\n\nErnst and Young (2000) ‘Global Online Retailing’ survey, Stores, Section 2, January\n\nChang Joshua (2005) ‘Online Shopping: Advantages over the offline alternative.’ [Online] http://www.arraydev.com/commerce/JIBC/0311-07.htm\n\nSchipper George (2005) ‘WI on Globalization’ [Online]\n\nhttp://www.wupperinst.org/globalisation/html/lit_global.html"},{title:"How To Meet That Special Someone",body:"Chances are unless you are very lucky you will go thru many different relationships before you find your special someone. Finding your sole mate is like gambling. In poker and blackjack you may have to play dozens of hands until you get a winning hand, and it is the same with relationships.\n\nDuring your life you will probably meet some people who seem like they may be the one, or that they are close, but still have the feeling that something else is missing. My advice is that if you are not happy, because something seems like it is missing, then it usually is not right.\n\nBefore I found my special someone, I was in a relationship for over 10 years, and I thought everything was great, until I started to seriously consider getting married. Then I noticed that we had so little in common and in reality wanted so many different things out of life and one day we both realized there was much about each of us that we both wanted from someone, but it was not us that we wanted.\n\nThen one day I decided I had enough of trying to go to clubs and bars to meet people. I was sick and tired of trying to find someone in the time it takes to finish a drink. It always seemed the ladies I would meet were all wrong for me, or they seemed great after talking to them for 5 minutes but they seemed to have no interest in me.\n\nThen one day I had an idea, it was not an original idea but I decided to use the internet to try to find the right person for me. So I proceeded to make a myspace profile. On this page I tried to put the real me and not the funny guy trying to be charming that was looking for love at the bar.\n\nAnd as I would at the poker rooms I went all in, I poured my heart and sole into this. I wrote what I wanted and wrote down who I truly think I am and not who I want to be, and I was rewarded by 1 email responding to my site.\n\nIt was amazing; the response I got was like a dream. Imagine you are sitting in a Las Vegas casino playing poker. You are down to your last few dollars, you go all in and you wind up being dealt a Royal Flush, and suddenly the sky is bluer, the grass is greener, and all your worries seem to just fade away.\n\nAt first things were a little awkward for the both of us. We decided to hold of on actually meeting until we got to know each other first. We spent a month just talking everyday on the internet. You can really open up to someone and show them the real you and not have to worry about rejection on the internet, after all you are just a faceless ghost, and if things don’t work out you could be sitting next to her on the bus one day without ever knowing it.\n\nThe key to finding happiness is realizing you are going to bust more then you are going to get blackjack, but you must keep trying, trying to remember you only need to find the real thing once."},{title:"Unmatched Toner Cartridge Quality 20 Less Than Oem Price",body:"For business professionals caught between high OEM price and mediocre print and graphic output, there’s a solution: Business Express’s Eclipse line of compatible laser toner cartridges that meet or exceed OEM quality for 20% less than typical OEM price. While even brand name OEMs display “This cartridge may contain recycled components” on packaging, only Business Express, a leading U.S.-based toner cartridge remanufacturer, uses all new internal components on its Eclipse line of compatible toner cartridges, and offers a guaranty on the cartridge and printer.\n\nTo ensure the blackest blacks and sharpest colors on every print job, the Eclipse OEM-compatible toner cartridges use just premium toner and all new internal components on every remanufactured toner cartridge.\n\nBecause this includes a brand new photoelectric drum, primary charge roller, magnetic rollers, wiper and doctor blades, as well as seals and end foams to prevent leaking, each toner cartridge prints at optimum quality to the end of is life cycle. In contrast, lower quality toner cartridges and even some OEM brands may reuse internal components over and over, diminishing print quality and reliability.\n\nBefore Business Express ships any Eclipse toner cartridge, rigorous print tests are conducted to ensure quality. This includes a solid page of black and a series of halftones to make certain that text prints crisp and clear. Color tests of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, including full solid prints and gradations, further ensure that up to 256,000 shades of color appear their best for photos, graphs, and other graphics.\n\n“It’s untrue that remanufactured toner cartridges can’t as good as OEM or will void the warranty,” says Business Express owner Dean Gutch. “By law OEMs can’t force you to buy their brand any more than a car dealer can force you to buy their oil filter. We’re so certain that Eclipse toner cartridges will meet or exceed OEM print quality that we guaranty not only the cartridge but also the printer.”\n\nBusiness Express remanufactures OEM-compatible laser toner cartridges for most major brands including Hewlett Packard, Minolta, Lexmark, and others. In addition to color and black and white toner cartridges, the company offers Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) toner cartridges, suitable by banks to print checks. They also build custom cartridges for those with special needs.\n\nIn addition to remanufacturing to satisfy the latest OEM microchip requirements, they ship nationally with next day delivery as well as internationally."},{title:"Facts Why Inkjet Printing Is Very Appealing Compared To Ordinary Printing",body:"If you are looking for a new way to promote your business that won’t cost you more money, maybe printing is one of the options you won’t resist. Printing is a widely use process in making printed materials that are used for advertising. Brochure, catalogs, flyers, banners, posters, and booklets are some of several examples of printed materials.\n\nNowadays, making printed materials have become fast, easy and simple. If you want your promotional material to be an eye-catching object, you should make it colored. By way of using inkjet printer this is not hard to make. An inkjet printer is any printer that places extremely small droplets of ink onto paper to create an image.\n\nSince the introduction of inkjet printing is in the latter half of the 1980s, inkjet printers have grown in popularity and performance while dropping significantly in price.\n\nInkjet printers are a type of printer that works by impelling tiny droplets of liquid ink onto paper. They are the most common type of printer for the general consumer due to its low cost, high quality of output, capability of printing in vivid color, and easy of use, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nA particular advantage of inkjet printing is that the process does not expose the material to heat or pressure. Accordingly it can be used on materials that could be damaged in lithographic or xerographic processes. For example, data or images can be added by inkjet printing to material produced on a laser printer whereas reprocessing the material in another laser printer could damage both the printer and the material.\n\nThe design and services that Inkjet Printing can do for you is an important factor that makes your advertisement really-really appealing.      	"},{title:"Understanding Operating Systems",body:"Every new computer that’s brought home from the store has an operating system installed onto it. But what most new computer users don’t realize, is that without an operating system, that computer would be a simple shell of possibilities. A powered computer lacking an operating system wouldn’t display anything more than a bunch of confusing text messages that describe the computer’s boot process. At the very end of this process, the computer looks for an operating system and if not found, it will prompt the user to tell it where it is.\n\nEarlier computers didn’t have an operating system and if you have experience with the computers of the early eighties, you’ll remember that most to them didn’t even have a hard drive! These old computers booted an MS-DOS type operating system from drivers stored onto a floppy disk, and in order to use a program, users would remove the boot floppy and then insert a new floppy that contained the program. The floppy not only stored the program (word processor, spreadsheet, etc.), it also stored the drivers that the program needed to communicate with the computer’s hardware. As you can imagine, the cumbersome process of switching from floppy to floppy prompted the birth of the operating system. An operating system is a software program that controls how the computer’s hardware (and installed software) works. It manages the activity of every component and then displays that activity as a user-friendly interface (GUI). It keeps track of where things exist on a computer’s hard drive as well. But perhaps most importantly for the end-user, the operating system is responsible for translating commands issued with a keyboard and mouse into binary code (010110101 stuff) that can communicate with a set of speakers, a printer, a scanner, and more.\n\nWith an operating system installed onto a computer’s hard drive, users no longer need to boot a computer with a floppy disk, nor do they need to run programs from a floppy disk. All the drivers of a program are stored onto the computer and used whenever a program is started.\n\nApple’s Macintosh computer was among the first of a couple systems to establish a user-to-hardware relationship through a user-friendly interface. Today, we have quite a few operating systems. Some of the more popular ones are Windows Vista, Mac OS X, ZETA, IBM, Unix, and Linux. But even still, operating systems have extended onto to non-computer devices such as game consoles, portable music players, and PDAs. Regardless of the device, the operating system installed onto it serves the same purpose across the board: to enable user-to-hardware communication.\n\nWhen you think about upgrading your computer to a new operating system, be careful to make sure that you have the necessary hardware components. We tried to upgrade one of our Windows 98 machines to Windows XP, but we were cautioned that the former may not be hardware compatible with XP technology. Apparently, the Windows XP operating system requires components that weren’t developed at the time Windows 98 was distributed and if we were to install Windows XP on this machine anyway, the new operating system would look for hardware that the computer didn’t have. And that would be an instant recipe for failure.\n\nAlso be careful about installing operating systems that are incompatible with existing hardware. The hardware of Macintosh computers is extremely different from the hardware of Windows computers and under no circumstances will a Windows operating system work on a Macintosh machine!"}]},function(e,t){e.exports=[{title:"Cooking Healthy For Radiant Health",body:"Who can resist the mouth-watering pictures in a cookbook? Who doesn’t have childhood memories of the fragrances that wafted from the kitchen on holidays, and even on regular, ordinary days? Spices, bread baking, cookies fresh out of the oven – all these trigger a deep longing in most of us. As eating holds a guaranteed spot in everybody’s daily schedule, so do those who prepare it. They have beome the uncrowned gods and goddesses of our lives.\n\nReal cooking consists of more than opening a can with a dull picture of green beans on the front, or popping a TV dinner from a wax-covered box into the oven or microwave. The true goal of cooking is to nourish these marvelous bodies that we live in, to allow them to grow and express vitality and strength, to keep them healthy and able to overcome environmental germs and bacteria. Summarized in one word, the main purpose of cooking is heath!\n\nWhen does a fruit or vegetable (or any baked item) furnish us with the most nutrition? The experts feel that food grown in one’s own environment will usually contain the most nutrition. Freshly harvested food provides the maximum nutritional value. After a fruit or vegetable has been sitting for several days, or transported around the world, the value of the vitamins and minerals diminishes.\n\nThe best means of ‘cooking’ fruits and vegetables for their health value is to eat them raw in salads or as snacks. As soon as heat is applied, a good quantity of the nutrition is destroyed. A good cook can prepare a beautiful plate with the natural colors of freshly picked fruits and vegetables.\n\nGenetically engineered food has infiltrated the growing of almost all crops. This procedure didn’t exist until the last decade, and it remains highly controversial as the long range effect on humans has never been tested.\n\nBriefly described, this procedure consists of infecting a healthy seed or grain with various bacteria or insects to lengthen its shelf life, to make it look ‘pretty’ for the consumer long after the nutritional value has dissolved. This not only has a negative effect on one’s health, but leaves the cook with a less than delicious product to serve.\n\nCooking with natural foods that are organically grown (that means with no harmful pesticides or chemical fertilizers) gives today’s health conscious cooks the best chance to delight in the time spent shopping and in the kitchen. Whipping up a carrot cake that will enchant both family and friends (best make two cakes while you’re at it), or preparing a quick but nutritious breakfast so the body will gleefully handle the challenges of the day without needing to be drugged by coffee or caffeine, make heading for the kitchen the favorite part of the day! Truly the cook is the god of the household!"},{title:"Choosing The Perfect Charcoal Grill",body:"Everyone loves good, old fashioned charcoal grilling. Aside from being cheaper than other grilling methods, it adds a raw, distinctive taste to your sausages, burgers, ribs, and other grilled items. Some people prefer charcoal grills over gas grills because they are easier to transport and are safer to use than gas. While there are differences in opinion and preference among grillers, it still remains that charcoal grills are here to stay. So be it an picnic, or an outdoor grill, charcoal grills will more that make up their worth in usefulness and reliability. When choosing charcoal grills, however, it pays to know what your needs are and to know the pros and cons of having such a grill over the other available grills around. 1. Cooking Space First of all, you have to determine how much space you need for grilling. If you are grilling for a small family of three, you will do well enough with a 75 square-inch grill. You will have to consider larger grills if you are cooking for more people. It doesn’t make sense if you bring a puny sub-75 inch grill to a large picnic. Remember that the size of your grill increases the amount of items you can grill exponentially. Just looking at the grill won’t give you a clear idea on how big the grilling area is. Some grills have a warming rack that increases the perceived size of your grill. \n\n2. Portability\n\n– Get grills that have wheels\n\n– Try choosing grills whose parts are ergonomic and efficient\n\n– Lessen the risk of damaging your grill when transporting\n\n– Your grill also has to withstand the rigors of outdoor use\n\n– It does not pay to purchase a flimsy looking grill – go for those that are durable and lasting \n\n3. Convenience\n\nSome charcoal grills come with their own igniters. Try choosing grills that have this option. Other grills need lighter fluid to fire up. With the built-in igniter, you will not need lighter fluid anymore. On the other hand, you may want to avoid lighter fluid altogether. Some people dislike the taste and smell this fluid adds to the grill. If you must, use alcohol instead. It burns odorless and does not ruin the flavor of your food. Choose grills that allow you to easily access the ash pan. This makes cleaning the grill a lot easier. It also lessens the amount of ash flakes that may settle in your food. Also, lids are a very important part of the grill. Choose a grill that has a lid to keep the heat trapped within the grill. This allows for faster and smokeless grilling. \n\nThe materials used in making the grill are also very important. Some grills are made of material that easily corrodes or does not stand up well against the elements. Stainless steel grills hold up remarkably well to both the weather and the heat of the grill. Try avoiding painted grills as the paint may easily flake of. Although lightweight, durable materials are hard to come by among grills, you would do best to look for such. Remember, though, that first and foremost, the most important built characteristic you are looking for in a grill is durability."},{title:"What You Need To Know About Oil Fondue",body:"Let’s talk about meat fondue recipes and what you need to know first. Meat fondue also known as oil fondue is a method of cooking all kinds of meats, poultry, and seafood in a pot of heated oil.\n\nEach person participating in a fondue experience, cooks his/her meat by placing a small portion or chunk on the end of a long fondue fork and placing it inside the pot of oil to cook. When the meat has finished cooking in the oil, it’s then placed on a small plate where you can then dip each piece of cooked meat into previously prepared sauces. Meat fondue recipes can also be prepared as a broth fondue, replacing the oil with your favorite broth – chicken, vegetable, or beef – to name a few.\n\nBelow, I’ve provided a pretty organized way of preparing and eating meat fondue recipes. Hope you find this helpful!\n\nFirst, it’s great fun and an easy way to entertain a good group of friends or family. With fondue cooking, everything can be done ahead of time and your guests cook their own food! How easy is that?\n\nOil fondue is used for cooking meats such as beef, lamb, chicken, fish, and seafood. The great thing is, you can do oil fondue as either an appetizer or as a main entree.\n\nSecond, you need a good and reliable cooking unit. With meat fondue recipes, the pot needs to be one that keeps the oil hot and is safe to use at your table. There are a wide range of fondue pots in a variety of styles. Some are complete sets including fondue condiment sets and special fondue plates and forks, as well as burner, stand, metal pot, and a tray to protect the table and catch spatters.\n\nOther types, you’ll need to buy each item separately. But that has its advantages in that you get to create your own customized fondue set in the colors you want and the accessories that you want to use.\n\nFondue pots are made specifically for a range of different purposes. Stainless steel, aluminum, copper and silver plate or sterling silver pots are generally used for oil and meat fondue recipes where enamel-coated cast iron or ceramic pots are used for cheese or chocolate fondues. In today’s market, you can also find non-stick coated fondue pots that make cleaning not such a chore.\n\nWith the wide variety of pots and cooking units also comes with a wide variety of price ranges – from very inexpensive to costly. The thing to look for, in my opinion, is the sturdiness in the construction of the pot. If you are looking for and all-purpose container that can be used for more than oil fondue, make sure the unit has the capability of being able to adjust the heat source.\n\nFondue Bourguignonne is a traditional meat fondue recipe. The pan used for this is wider at the base and curves in at the top. Why? Because it eliminates some of the spattering that occurs when raw meat hits the hot oil and the shape helps to hold the heat. Most bourguignonne pots are are 1 1/2 to 2-quart capacity.\n\nWhat if you don’t have a fondue pot or don’t want to spend the money on one? You can always improvise with any good heating unit that burns denatured alcohol, canned heat, or butane. The container for the oil could be any saucepan or chaffing dish. It must be one that is at least 3 1/2 inches deep and not more than about 8 inches in diameter. If it has straight sides and possibly curves inward at the top, even better. Like the bourguignonne pan, it reduces splatters and keeps the heat.\n\nSome other items used with fondue pots:\n\nFondue forks and plates are designed for cooking and serving meat fondue recipes and are available in a wide range of materials, sizes, shapes, colors, and of course, price ranges.\n\nLong bamboo skewers can be used instead of forks. The disadvantage is, it’s sometimes harder to keep the meat or bread on the skewer while it is cooking and the oil can be so hot that you risk getting too close to it and burning yourself.\n\nFondue forks are long – at least 10 inches long – and have insulated tips for safety from burning when using oil or broth fondues. The tines on the forks should be generous in length and not made of flimsy materials.\n\nMany places that sell fondue pots and their accessories will provide a set of forks with different colored handles for each. This works similarly to the little doo-dads we attach to wine glasses for identification purposes. There’s also a fun fondue game you can play to get the party started.\n\nFondue plates are special because they have little sections built into them in the form of small indentations for sauces and a larger section for the meat. They are convenient and nice to have, but not necessary. These plates are usually available in ceramic, china, pottery, plastic or metal.\n\nFondue sauce bowls are often used and are particularly festive when the colors or designs of the bowls complement the rest of the fondue set. They are passed around with the different fondue sauces to each of the guests.\n\nBelow is the recipe for Fondue Bourguignonne:\n\nWhat you’ll need:\n\n– 3 pound piece boneless beef sirloin or tenderloin\n\n– 2 cups cooking oil (canola or other vegetable oil)\n\nOR\n\n– 1 cup oil + 1 cup Clarified Butter\n\n– Salt and Pepper to taste\n\n– Dipping Sauces (check out all the wonderful dipping sauces you can make on my web site. See info below.) \n\nTrim the fat from the meat and cut into bite-size cubes. Keep refrigerated until about 20 minutes before serving. This recipe lends itself to doing everything in advance of your party, makeing it an easy recipe. Important: Please feel free to republish this article on your web site or in your ezine.

There are countless ways you can turn your grilling not only into a flavorful and enjoyable way to cook, but there are also many healthy and tasty alternatives. Like anything else in life, what you put on your grill is a choice. Grilling healthy first means that you have decided to eat healthy. Cooking on a grill can be a great way to reduce fats on while adding wonderful flavor however we must also be careful when grilling as there can be certain risks if precautions are not taken. Eating healthy always begins with choosing healthy foods that are low in fat and using marinates to reduce unhealthy caseinogens. We know that charcoal grilling can produce carcinogenic smoke from the high temperature cooking of foods containing fat and protein. This can produce unhealthy chemical changes in the outer layers of flesh foods. To avoid these dangerous chemical formations we must avoid inhaling the smoke and avoid the black char on the outside of charcoal cooked food caused by high heat and/or overcooking. It is also advised that any lighter fluid or self-lighting packages be avoided as they can also add toxic chemicals directly into your food. Instead, use a starter chimney and newspaper to get your charcoal lit. While this method may initially take a few more minutes, in the long run it’s faster and healthier. The use of marinades can also help greatly lower caseinogens in food. By using a marinade your food will not only take on extra flavor but even a simple marinade consisting of olive oil and a citrus juice can reduce the harmful chemicals by as much as 99%. A marinade will also assist in tenderizing and enhancing your food’s natural flavors. There has been a lot of talk about grilling and the risk of cancer. While the risk is real and this should be kept in mind, there are some simple things you can do to greatly reduce the risk of cancer caused by grilling. The harmful chemicals that can form are created by putting food, primarily meats, under intense heat and flame. These are cancer forming agents however by taking a few simple precautions you can greatly reduce and even eliminate the risks. Grilling isn’t the only cooking method that causes these agents so there is no reason to give up on your grill. If done right, grilling is one of the healthiest methods of cooking. \n\nTo reduce the risks follow these basic tips:      	"},{title:"Barbecue The Secrets Of The Greek Way",body:"I have taste grilled meats around the world. Before i will guide you to the various technologies (gas barbecues, charcoal barbecues, Mongolian, sauces, recipes ) i will tell you about the Greek way. We Greeks like good food so i will start from the meat. Whatever the technology, the recipe and the sauce, if the meat is from a producer which feeds his animals the traditional way the taste will be superb. Period.\n\nThere is no equivalent of a natural rosen meat of beef ,lamp or pork. The taste is magic ! If you come for holidays in Greece you will see in the morning or in the afternoon the old lady with the two or three cows , or goats. These animals will be served in the local taverna. For this meat i am talking about. If we talk about the islands where the goats are drinking sea water and eating the local wild weeds we are talking about a superior quality meat almost presalted. If you ever go in CRETE taste it, you will remember my words. In case you will visit northern Greece try local Veal stake. You can locate the good food where you will see no foreigners at all.\n\nSo lets move around Athens and check the best ones. One of the best barbecue tavern in Athens area is Telis in Evripidou Str.\n\nTelis is the master of pork chops. This is his specialty. If you order for a plate you will notice about four to five pieces above fried potatoes. He is all day open and very economical also. Its a kind of fast pork steak food. It is a must taste since you visit Athens. Another must taste is Thanasis kebab souvlaki in Thision. It is mixed lamp and veal chopped meat over charcoals. You may eat a plate of four of them , with grilled tomatoes, or you might taste the traditional way in a pita. Any way its very difficult to eat only one. If you like hot papers ask them.\n\nOne more must eat souvlaki in Athens is LEIBADIA in kANIGOS SQUARE. There you can have the traditional pork souvlaki with all the village bread you can eat. They produce all day long so whenever you will be there you will taste it straight from the charcoals. All around Greece we like to barbecue on charcoals. The device we choose must be proven in producing our favorite taste. Our meat are premarinated with olive oil, salt, pepper, origanon. During grill we add a little of olive oil-salt-origanon mix in order to produce the tasty smell, which gives this delicious aromatic taste to the meat.\n\nThe fire must be strong but not so strong to provoke fires under the meat. For this purpose we have a bottle of vinegar to extinguish it in case of. We add fresh lemon just before we consume them. We don’t take out the fat before we grill our meat because we like the taste of the smoked meat.\n\nOne more famous place for barbecue souvlaki is the Corinth bridge. This is the bridge which you enter Peloponnesus. Do not pass the bridge and miss the taste of this souvlaki. Thousands of people stop every day to taste this local delicacy."},{title:"Which Grill Should You Buy Charcoal Or Gas",body:"If you are considering purchasing a new grill, or barbecue, you will be faced with a multitude of options to choose between. However, there is one choice which you will need to make fairly quickly in your quest for the perfect grill for you. That decision is whether to buy a charcoal or gas grill.\n\nBoth charcoal and gas grills have advantages over each other depending on what you are looking for and how you intend to use it. However, the good news is that they both produce food which has been found to have very little difference in taste. Whether you choose the gas or charcoal version you can rest assured that they will both have the capability to produce great tasting fare.\n\nFor many, a barbecue is not a proper barbecue if it does not involve cooking over hot coals. This can take a long time to be at the optimum cooking temperature and can be difficult to master, and in addition there are ashes to be dealt with once the cooking is over. However, the primal instinct in many people (particularly men!) makes the charcoal grill appeal to them as they are required to start and tend the fire for the duration of the time for which they are cooking. In addition, many feel that cooking over coals gives the food a distinctive taste and smell which you do not get with a gas grill. However, as mentioned previously, this has not been found to be the case.\n\nA gas grill can make life less complicated. The flames are produced at the touch of a button and the temperature can be controlled at the turn of a knob. This is more like cooking over a traditional kitchen cooker, only outside. A gas grill also removes the debris once the cooking is over as there are no coals to clean up.\n\nAs you can see, both types of grill have their advantages. However, it is important to think about your use of your grill before making your decision. If you plan to use it infrequently you may prefer a charcoal grill as they are less costly. A gas grill will cost more to buy, but if you are going to use it regularly it will become more efficient over time. For the newcomer to the grill, a charcoal grill may be the most sensible option. If you find you are using it a lot and it is becoming expensive to buy new coals you will then have the opportunity to upgrade to a gas barbecue if you wish. If you splash out for a gas grill immediately you may find that if you use it infrequently it will be an unnecessary expense that you need not have made.\n\nWhichever you choose, there is little between the two types of grill in terms of the quality of the food cooked on them. Make your decision wisely and your grill is sure to be enjoyed on many occasions over time and makes a great addition to any summer evening."},{title:"The Benefits And Drawbacks Of Buying Designer Kitchenware Products",body:"If you are in the market for kitchenware, you may be considering making the purchase of designer kitchenware products.

You will find all types of cast iron pots, pans, skillets, tea kettles, and even large dutch ovens. Those who routinely use cast iron swear by it’s versatility and durability. I personally think that a good set of cast iron cookware is hard to beat.\n\nThere are a few conditions that you do have to meet when using cast iron. One of these is seasoning the new cast iron items that you buy or maintaining the seasoning of the ones you already own. Seasoning of cast iron is required to promote a non-stick surface on the cookware and make it easier to clean. Another consideration when dealing with cast iron cookware is maintaining the items in an environment where they will not begin to rust. Rust is one of the true enemies of the otherwise durable product. If these two conditions are met, then the cast iron cookware that you buy today, could still be in everyday service a hundred years from now.\n\nThe first aspect of seasoning cast iron is to start with a clean pan. Take the newly purchased item and remove any adhesive from stickers, and any other foreign material that does not belong. Washing the pan with warm soapy water and then drying it completely is normally sufficient. Next, pre-heat your oven to about 250 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. The next step is to use lard or some other animal fat like bacon grease to start the seasoning process. Avoid vegetable oils as they tend to get very sticky and can ruin a brand new pan. Coat the inside of the pan with the lard and place it into the pre-heated oven for about 20 to 30 minutes. You will want to keep an eye on it to make sure the grease doesn’t get too hot and start to smoke during this process. Once time has passed remove the pan and get rid of the excess grease inside the cast iron pan. Then, put the pan back in the oven for another 20 minutes or so to finish the seasoning process. A new cast iron pan may require several treatments like this to establish a good “layer” of seasoning. What I mean is that you may have to do this a couple of times before the pan starts to become really non-stick and easy to use for everyday cooking jobs. Afterwards, you can use the cast iron to cook and it wouldn’t hurt to use it to fry bacon or something fatty every once in a while to help maintain good seasoning on the pan.\n\nAs mentioned before, rust is one of cast irons true weak points. Rust can quickly turn a beautiful, well seasoned pan into a useless eyesore that you aren’t quite sure what to do with. Preventing cast iron from rusting is simple if you remember a few guidelines. Always store your cast iron in a dry place. Do not keep it under the kitchen sink or hanging above your stove where it will be exposed to a steady supply of steam. Never put your cast iron away without thoroughly drying it. An easy way to dry cast iron is to place it in a hot oven for about five minutes or put it on a stove burner on high for a minute or so. This will burn off any excess water left over from when you washed it and will almost guarantee the avoidance of rust. If you do discover that your cast iron treasures have become rusted over time, there are steps to reclaim them. You may even come across a beautiful historic piece of cast iron at a yard sale or flea market and decide to revive it. Check out my article on restoring rusted cast iron cookware for more tips on reviving your rusty cast iron.\n\nWith a proper knowledge in seasoning and caring for cast iron cookware, you can enjoy all of the benefits of cast iron without all of the drawbacks that are inherent to it. With the proper care, the cast iron pans that you buy and use today can be handed down to your children and grandchildren for them to enjoy."},{title:"How To Cook A Tender Juicy Steak",body:"You invest a lot of time and money into the steaks for a special occasion and when dinner time comes, they are tough. What happened? How can you cook steaks as tender as your favorite restaurant? \n\nThe first step to cooking a good steak is to choose the right grade of steak. The top quality beef is graded USDA Prime and commands top prices. USDA Prime grade meats are sold to the restaurant industry and specialty markets and are not as likely to be found at your local grocery chain. The next grade of beef is USDA Choice. USDA Choice is tender, flavorful and only slightly lower in quality than USDA Prime. The meat is well marbled with fat and will be tender and juicy when properly prepared. USDA Choice makes up about 70% of all graded beef and is readily available in your supermarket. USDA Good graded beef is an acceptable grade of beef that has only minimal marbling of fat. It is leaner, but may not be as tender as USDA Prime or Choice. \n\nNext, look at the color and texture of the meat. A good steak should be firm to the touch, moist, and bright in color. It should be well marbled with thin streaks of white fat throughout and a thin crust of steak on the outside. In our fat conscious society, we tend to look for lean cuts of meat, but the thin streaks of white fat marbled throughout the meat are the key to a tender juicy steak. \n\nThe most tender and juicy steaks come from the sirloin, the short loin, and the rib. These steaks include the sirloin steaks, porterhouse steaks, t-bone steaks, rib steaks, delmonico steaks, and the filet mignons. Steaks containing bone will weigh more than those without, but the bone adds flavor to the steak.\n\nAging is a desirable process that intensifies the flavors and makes the meat more tender. Aged steaks are more expensive and usually only found in high end supermarkets and specialty markets. An aged steak is recognizable by its darker color.\n\nOnce you have purchased your steak, you can further increase the tenderness and juiciness by marinating it. Try a marinade made of       "},{title:"Cooking Indian Food At Home Where To Start",body:"If you read my article, Curry – A Journey, published on the Curry page of this site, you’ll know that my first experiences of the dish were of the generic variety which the British invariably cooked and ate when living abroad a few decades ago. You’ll also know that I then discovered “real” Indian cookery and decided that as I couldn’t afford to eat out that much, I needed to learn how to cook the stuff myself.\n\nMy first stop then, was a local bookshop, where the choice of books on Indian cookery was somewhat limited. However, I struck lucky and discovered a book called Indian Cookery by Madhur Jaffrey – what a find. Written in simple language but with lovely descriptive text and recommendations on what to serve with what, it was just what I had been looking for.\n\nThere was a stumbling block, however, which was the endless list of spices, seasonings and flavourings in the front of the book. I didn’t know where to start – I’d heard of quite a lot of them, having watched a few TV programmes on Indian cooking but, “help” I thought, “buying that many all at once is going to cost a fortune”. If you’re thinking the same, don’t panic. Check in your store cupboard. You probably already have some of the items you will need. For example, look for black peppercorns, bay leaves, chilli powder (if you’re already a fan of chilli con carne), ground ginger, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon if you bake cakes or apple pies. Maybe you’ll find mustard seeds if you do your own pickling and sesame seeds if you make rolls or cook Chinese food. That only leaves a few basic ingredients which appear in a lot of Indian recipes – cumin, coriander, turmeric and cardamom. Often you need ground cumin and coriander but if you buy the whole spices, you can grind them as necessary (and they keep longer that way too).\n\nThe other thing I did was to choose a fairly simple recipe to start with and I just bought the spices I needed for that. The next time I want to cook an Indian meal, I chose another recipe with similar ingredients so I had to just buy a couple more things. Soon enough I built up a whole store cupboard of the things I needed and it didn’t have had such a drastic effect on my wallet.\n\nThen there was no stopping me – I even know some recipes by heart now and you can do the same if you want to.\n\nYou don’t need special equipment for Indian cookery, although I wouldn’t be without my electric coffee grinder (to grind spices) and it’s nice (but not necessary) to have the traditional dishes to serve your meal in. Other than that, you need a bit of patience and it’s fun to cook with a friend so that you can share the chopping and grinding or have someone read the recipe out to you step by step so you don’t go wrong in the middle.\n\nThe flavours are great, a curry evening is really sociable, so go on, give it a try."},{title:"Alfredo And Who On Earth Was He",body:"If you ask for Pasta Alfredo in a restaurant in Italy all you get from your waiter is a stare. Why is one of the most famous “Italian sauces” for pasta unknown in its country of origin? The answer is simple: because in Italy Pasta Alfredo doesn’t exist.\n\nYes, Italians make a dish of pasta, fettuccine dressed with nothing else than good aged parmigiano cheese and a lot of butter, but is such a simple preparation that Italians don’t even consider it a “recipe”.\n\nWaverly Root in his famous book “The Food of Italy” (New York, 1971) wrote: “FETTUCCINE AL BURRO is associated in every tourist’s mind with Rome, possibly because the original Alfredo succeeded in making its serving a spectacle reminiscent of grand opera. It is the same ribbon shaped egg pasta tat is called tagliatelle in Bologna; but the al burro preparation is very Roman indeed in its rich simplicity. Nothing is added to the pasta except grated cheese and butter – lots of butter. The recipe calls for doppio burro, double butter, which gives it a golden color.”\n\nWho was Alfredo then? Alfredo di Lelio, this was his full name, was an inspired cook who proposed this new exciting dish in the restaurant he opened in Rome in 1914. It was a high gourmet preparation in the Roman tradition of simplicity. Apparently he created his Fettuccine all’Alfredo when his wife lost her appetite during her pregnancy. To bring back her appetite he prepared for her a nutritious dish of egg fettuccine with parmigiano cheese and butter. That probably gave him the idea for his “triple butter” fettuccine.\n\nHe was an extravagant character who used to personally serve his paper-thin fettuccine with golden forks, apparently donated to him by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, the famous silent movie stars. In the fifties and sixties, Hollywood discovered Rome. Paparazzi photographers took photos of actors such as Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner, Richard Burton, Liz Taylor, or Sophia Loren in front of a plate of Fettuccine all’Alfredo, making his restaurant famous all around the world. The restaurant is now run buy his grandson, and the golden forks are still used to serve this dish for special occasions.\n\nSamuel Chamberlain, journalist and food writer, met Alfredo in the late fifties and wrote in his book “Italian Bouquet – An Epicurean Tour of Italy” (New York, 1958): “Finally there is the great Alfredo, showman par excellence, who draws an endless file of amazed and hungry tourists to watch his calisthenics over a dish of hot noodles. The King of Noodles has come out of retirement, and now wields his golden fork and spoon at ALFREDO ALL’AUGUSTEO, at number 31 on the Piazza Augusto Imperatore. His Maestosissime Fettuccine all’Alfredo are most majestic, without a doubt. […] You have to visit this place at least once, we suppose, just to say you have seen this elderly, melodramatic good-hearted clown in action.”\n\nSo, forget the heavy cream, the parsley, the garlic, and all the other stuff suggested in the hundreds of Alfredo recipes that circulate around. Take down from the shelf that pasta machine, prepare your fresh fettuccine (you can substitute fresh fettuccine with excellent dry egg noodles), and enjoy the simple Maestosissime Fettuccine al Triplo Burro the way Alfredo himself would do them."},{title:"Barbecue Sauce For A Perfect Barbeque",body:"When someone mentions barbecue images comes to the mind like cooking at the backyard grill, a social gathering, cooking outdoors and cooking meat slowly over wood and smoke that adds flavor to the food. Different cooks have different preferences and style in their cooking. Some prefer rubbing the seasoning whether wet or dry prior to cooking and some prefers to soak the meat first in special marinades that could be sops, mops and finishing. The preparation and ingredients for marinating may differ from region to region the preferred wood to be used can also differ. However, no perfect barbecue will taste as good without the perfect barbecue sauce.\n\nBarbecue sauces can generally be categorized by what they are based on. Common examples are tomato, vinegar and mustard based sauces. To give the barbecue its distinctive taste and prevent the meat from burning easily, barbecue sauces are applied to the meat while being cooked with the exemption of tomato based barbecue sauces as tomato based sauces burns easier than the other kinds of sauces. Barbecue sauce preparation can either be sweet, sour, tangy, spicy, hot, thick or thin. The varieties are almost endless which makes barbecues popular because anyone can make his own special preparation depending on taste and anyone can create his own way of serving the barbecue. Recipes for barbecues can also be guarded. And good barbecue sauces can be purchased at almost any store. But the only perfect barbecue sauce is the one that you can create for yourself. Remember whatever works for you and your family can be a great barbecue sauce. So start experimenting that is the only way to start good cooking.\n\nThe basics of Barbecue sauces…\n\nTomato based barbecue sauce is the most widely used. Some say that it is the most popular. Its popularity however may be due to the simplicity of preparation and besides; tomatoes are ingredients that could easily be found. The point to remember in preparing tomato-based barbecue sauces is to cook the tomatoes very well in order for the flavor to blend with the other ingredients. Tomato based barbecue sauces are acidic. Because of this, it has the property to breakdown all the flavor of other ingredients blending them with its own. But because of its propensity to burn, limit the usage of tomato based barbecue sauce while cooking. To make it even more flavorful, prepare tomato barbecue sauces a day in advance.\n\nMustard based sauces are preferred in North Carolina. The mustard based barbecue sauce is great for grilling pork.\n\nVinegar is great meat tenderizer. It is also more acidic than tomatoes. Because of its acidic content, vinegar based sauces has a tendency to penetrate deep into the meat. To make this barbecue sauce more flavorful, experiment mixing it with chili, cider vinegar or red pepper, sugar salt and all the other ingredients that you want it to have. Barbecue sauces today has different uses departing from its traditional purpose. It now serves as a condiment that is present on almost any table like ketchup, salsa, salt, pepper and Tabasco. However, if experimenting with food is not your greatest strength, you can always find great sauces in any store. To make great barbecues, one rule to follow is not to place too much weight on the “with smoke flavor” label that many bottled tomato sauces advertise itself. Smoke flavor is what is barbecuing all about. The flavor has to come from the wood not the bottle."},{title:"Capt N Salsa S Grill Roasted Yard Bird",body:"Wow I have a hankering for some really good grill roasted chicken, the melt in your mouth variety with some fresh homemade salsa slathered right on top.

Often, such an important detail is simply overlooked or is considered to be minor. In fact, proper understanding of differences between cookware materials will assist you in making the best choice and further on, will help maintain your cookware in a good shape.\n\nStainless steel cookware is very common thank to its moderate price and a number of qualities, such as good tensile strength, excellent corrosion resistance and non-reaction with alkaline or acidic materials. Using stainless steel cookware allows using less oil and it better preserves the nutritious value of food. The drawback is that stainless steel does not conduct heat well, so the cookware requires a thick aluminum or copper core in the bottom and, sometimes, the sides to conduct heat more evenly and make the cookware more responsive to heat. Stainless steel cookware care is quite simple as it can be washed in a dishwasher and scraped with nylon pads. Special stainless steel cleaners will help bring the shine back.\n\nNon-stick cookware is a blessing when cooking and reheating sticky kinds of food. This coated surface also means you will need less oil or fat while frying on it. But you have to be careful while using and washing non-stick cookware. Avoid scratches on the surface or it’ll lose its properties. Use only wooden, plastic, or coated utensils when cooking. Wash in hot soapy water but never in a dishwasher. Cast iron is comparatively inexpensive, conducts heat evenly and once heated, keeps it for a long time. Such cookware is good for deep-frying and slow cooking. The main problem is that it rusts, stains and becomes pitted when exposed to air, moisture and certain foods. Do not wash cast-iron cookware in soapy water, instead try wiping clean with a paper towel. To prevent rusting, remove any excess moisture from the surface and coat with oil before storing.\n\nAluminum cookware is quite cheap compared to other materials. It’s very lightweight yet strong. It is a good conductor of heat and does not easily distort when exposed to high temperatures. The obvious drawback is its reaction to acidic and alkaline foods leading to corrosion and spoiling the taste of the food cooked. That’s why it is often coated with stainless steel or anodized coating to protect the food. It doesn’t require any special care, usual washing in a soapy water is enough. However, if the surface has anodized coating, you better avoid washing the cookware in a dishwasher and be careful not to scratch the finish. Lined copper cookware is quite expensive, though has a number of advantages. It conducts and responses to heat very well, cools down quickly when removed from the heat, preventing food from burning and becoming overdone. Copper cookware is a good choice for many cooking methods. The main problem is that copper interacts with everything it comes in contact with. Moisture in the air causes it to form a film on it that is poisonous and salty food causes a chemical reaction that can make food have a metallic taste. For that reason copper cookware is lined with tin, silver or stainless steel to enhance its qualities. Care includes delicate washing with soapy water and regular polishing with special copper polish to keep its bright copper shine."},{title:"The Wonderful Tools Of Cooking",body:"Far too often people overlook the importance of using the proper tools when cooking fine meals. While there is nothing in the world that can quite compare to cooking with the finest and freshest of ingredients, these things can only be enhanced by making use of the perfect tools for the job at hand. When it comes to pots and pans and skillets you should keep in mind that conductivity is of extreme importance. You should also select pots and pans that are made of a heavier gauge. This allows your pans to heat evenly avoiding hot spots, which can lead to food that may ‘stick’ to your pan or scorch during the cooking process. This means that simply stopping in at your local mass market retailer and purchasing any old set of pots and pans is probably not the best course of action for the best possible quality in your kitchen. Kitchen knives are also important ingredients in the kitchens of today. If you plan to prepare many meals in your kitchen, then the quality of your knives is of the utmost importance. Your knives are an investment you shouldn’t have to make too often in your lifetime. For this reason, select a really good set and be prepared to make a sizeable investment in your knives. You will never understand, unless you’ve tried to prepare foods with knives of inferior quality, just how important it is to purchase good quality and well-balanced knives for your kitchen. You should also try the handles in your hand to see how comfortable they feel before purchasing a set of knives. If you do a lot of chopping and cutting during your meal preparation and cooking you will want to make sure that the knives you are using feel comfortable in your hands. \n\nIf you are like me and plan on cooking a great deal of meat then you should also invest in a jacquard. This useful tool helps not only when it comes to tenderizing rather rough and tumble cuts of meat but also pierces the surface so that rubs and marinades can penetrate for a more flavorful experience. This is by far one of my favorite kitchen gadgets and it isn’t a sizeable investment for the added value it provides to meals. A good quality grater is another tool that no kitchen should be complete without. There are many who feel that with all the pre shredded cheese products on the market today this tool is obsolete but nothing could be further from the truth. First of all, pre grated and pre packaged cheese simply doesn’t touch the quality of flavor that freshly grated cheese provides. Second, cheese isn’t the only thing that these graters are useful for grating. Graters are excellent tools for grating citrus fruits, spices, garlic, chocolate, and even onions. If you do a good deal of baking in addition to your cooking you should not overlook the value of having a quality grater in your kitchen.\n\nOf course there are many more cooking tools than I could possibly mention here. Those mentioned above simply happen to be among my personal favorites. There are all kinds of appliances that in my humble opinion no kitchen is truly complete without. In addition to these great appliances there are many tools that are simple matters of preference. Do you peel enough potatoes to warrant a special device for doing so or do you simply opt to purchase an ergonomically designed potato peeler and peel them by hand? There are no one size fits all answers when it comes to kitchen tools and many of us are often limited by serious budget constraints and restrictions. My best advice if this is the situation for you is to purchase the best possible quality you can afford and build from there. Even if it means replacing one pot or knife at a time until you can manage a complete set of superior quality cooking tools you will find it well worth the price you’ve paid in the long run."

Whether it’s a backyard BBQ, a picnic at the park or a daily glass of iced tea, people need safe, clean ice.\n\nRecent news reports have shown that some ice in fast-food restaurants is dirtier than toilet water. Whether processed and packaged from a moldy ice machine, mishandled through the use of dirty buckets or even hand-scooped by dirty hands, it is difficult to know exactly what you’re buying and consuming. Here are a few tips for purchasing clean, safe ice:\n\n• Ice should be clear in color as well as odorless and tasteless.\n\n• The bag should be properly closed and secure.\n\n• The bag should have the manufacturer’s name, address and phone number.\n\n• The bag should be free of any foreign objects.\n\n• The bag should have a product code.\n\nAccording to a recent study conducted by Michigan State University, there is a heightened concern with safety of foods among consumers. In fact, 63 percent of the consumers interviewed are very or fairly concerned about the safety of the foods they eat and almost half of the respondents said they do not buy foods that are likely to be unsafe.\n\nThis summer, the International Packaged Ice Association (IPIA) wants you to know that all ice is not created equal and that ice shoppers need to be selective. When buying packaged ice, look for a product that has been packaged by a certified IPIA member and carries the IPIA seal.\n\nThe seal means that the packaged ice consumers are buying meets the association’s strict quality and safety policy. The stringent Packaged Ice Quality Control Standards (PIQCS) are mandated for all IPIA members to ensure safe and quality ice. The standards regulate employees’ personal hygiene, sanitary operations of the facilities, equipment and utensils used in making ice, quality of the water source and continuous microbiological testing of the finished product."},{title:"Keep That Cooking Area Clean",body:"One of the most prevalent illnesses today is food poisoning. It starts as a slight discomfort a few hours after eating and grows into a life- threatening episode requiring hospitalization.\n\nThe most common cause are the salmonella e-coli and listeria bacteria. And, they can be common problems in the chef’s kitchen.\n\nCommon breeding grounds for bacteria are kitchen towels, dish rags and brushes, cutting boards, kitchen sinks, door, drawer and refrigerator handles. Little things like timers, whisk handles, pepper mills and salt shakers also become breeding grounds for bacteria. You can also add bottles of oil, spice jars, can openers and the controls on your stove or ovens.\n\nFood itself can be storage places for bacteria with the culprits chicken and other poultry, eggs, raw meats, dairy products, and even fresh fruits and veggies.\n\nIn addition to washing your hands regularly while cooking here is a list of things you should do in your kitchen to reduce the likelyhood of food poisoning:\n\n1. Wash poultry in ice cold water when you bring it home from the supermarket and refrigerate immediately. Cook it as soon as possible.\n\n2. Wash your hands and everything else that comes in contact with raw poultry.\n\n3. Wash, never reuse knives, cutting boards, towels or anything else that touches raw poultry without washing them. This means don’t use the cutting board or knives to chop vegetables or anything elsethat will not be cooked immediately.\n\n4. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom. Your family is not immune to your personal e-coli!\n\n5. Wash all vegetables immediately after you bring them home from the market. This includes all fruit including watermelons, strawberries, peaches, mangos, grapes, and almost every other fruit including bananas.\n\n6. Use a lot of paper towels that can be thrown away. Dish rags and towels are one of the biggest breeding grounds for bacteria.\n\n7. Keep your kitchen counters clean. Use a diluted bleach or disinfectant before and after meal preparation.\n\n8. Refrigerate foods as much as you can and read the labels on condiments, sauces, jams and jellies to see if they need refrigeration after opening. DO NOT LEAVE MAYONNAISE ON THE COUNTER ON A SUMMER DAY! That goes for anything made with the mayonnaise as well.\n\n9. Gently wash eggs in ice cold water before putting them in the fridge. There is nothing sterile about an egg that came from the chicken coop.\n\n10. Buy your meat, especially hamburger, from a reputable butcher shop.\n\n11. Make sure you have a meat thermometer and make sure all meat is cooked to the proper temperature to kill the dangerous bacteria in meats, poultry and fish.\n\n12. Wash your hands!! I can’t repeat this enough!\n\n13. Plan your grocery shopping so you go home immediately after you purchase perishable foods.\n\n14. If fish smells like fish, don’t buy it! If anything smells “off” or not what\n\nyou are accustomed to, don’t buy it.\n\n15. If a can or jar whooshes when you open it, throw it away or better yet, take it back to the store.\n\n16. Drain things over the sink, not in it. This place is teeming with bacteria. Sterilize it often, but still keep edible food out of it."},{title:"Cast Iron Cookware",body:"How to Season and Care for Your Cast Iron Cookware\n\nYou have a skillet that came from your mom, and before that your grandma, and has now fallen into your hands. So how do you take care of it, use it, clean it, and get the best taste possible from it? I hope to answer some of those questions in this article.\n\nI love my cast iron skillets, passed down from my Mom; I remember her using them to make delicious fried chicken dinners, cornbread to go with our Great Northern beans and the best popcorn. The only thing I didn’t remember is just what she did to keep those skillets nice. I do remember her drying them slowly on the stove and then coating them with some sort of grease. Now we would use a thin coat of cooking oil or a pan spray.\n\nThat is called seasoning and is important in the care and use of cast iron to prevent rust and create a natural non-stick cooking surface. Even if your inherited skillet or Dutch oven has been neglected and rusty, you can restore it by seasoning it again.\n\nThe more you use your cast iron the better seasoned it becomes. A black shiny skillet is a well-seasoned utensil and the one that will give the best flavor. Seasoning is done both for the inside and the outside of your cast iron, and even the lid must be seasoned. Here’s a hint to make your cast iron shiny again is to fry bacon and similar fatty meats. It will help it become seasoned faster and give you that shiny black non-stick interior you are working for.\n\nHere are the steps to seasoning your cast iron utensils.\n\n1. First, wash with hot, soapy water and stiff brush.\n\n2. Rinse and dry\n\n3. Apply a thin coat of shortening both inside and out\n\n4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line oven rack with foil to catch drips\n\n5. Put cookware upside down on the upper rack of your oven and bake for one hour.\n\n6. Let the cookware cool before taking it out of the oven.\n\n7. Store it in a cool, dry place and allow air to circulate around it\n\n8. Never wash in a dishwasher.\n\nAfter using your cast iron, rinse with hot water and no soap. Dry it thoroughly and coat it with a think coat of cooking oil, shortening or pan spray."},{title:"Aussie Chef Shares Culinary Secrets With Americans",body:"What if a famous Australian chef came to your home and offered to make dinner?\n\nThat’s the premise of a new television cooking show-but with a twist. Chef Curtis Stone is making his debut on American television, ambushing unsuspecting shoppers with an offer they simply can’t refuse. Each episode in the series called “Take Home Chef,” shown Fridays at 8:00 p.m. on TLC, begins with a covert Stone racing through a grocery store as he searches for the perfect culinary partner. Once he’s found one he turns on the charm, offering to accompany the shopper home and prepare a gourmet meal using the items in his or her shopping cart-plus a few savory extras. Once participants seem willing to go along with this culinary adventure, they take Stone home and work with him in their own kitchens or out at the grill to create a delicious dinner. And, as Australians are known for “throwing another one on the barbee,” Chef Stone is likely to be sharing a lot of his grilling secrets from Down Under, while at the same time learning how to function in an average American kitchen. Some of the grilling tips offered in “Take Home Chef” include:\n\n• When cooking larger pieces of meat, like roasts, pile the coals on one side and place the food on the other. This allows for indirect cooking and reduces charring.\n\n• Don’t use charcoal lighter fluid or briquettes that have added starter fluid built into them. This will leave an unpleasant taste in the smoke. • Rubs are one of the best things you can use to add flavor to your meat. They are combinations of spices that seal in the flavor of the meat, form a tasty crust, enhance color and pull moisture from the air while drawing juices from inside the meat, causing the meat to marinate itself as it cooks.\n\nChef Curtis Stone started his culinary career at The Savoy Hotel, in his hometown of Melbourne, Australia at the age of 18. The European and British chefs he knew there taught him the importance of working abroad to increase one’s experience and skills. That’s why, once he’d qualified as a chef, he set off for Europe to experience Italy, France and Spain before finally arriving in London. There, he was eventually promoted to be head chef at the critically acclaimed Quo Vadis, a London institution since 1926. So what’s this new American TV show like for Chef Stone? “Cooking in someone else’s home can be absolutely anything; it can be fabulous or a complete disaster,” he says. “It’s the fear of the unknown that makes it so exciting.”"},{title:"Grilling Tips For The Dog Days Of Summer",body:"Grilling is going to the dogs.

Barbecuing is also a form of art. To a person who is new to this art may get confused, because cooking meat in an open fire is a really tricky method. In order to get a really good and delicious bbq dish, one must have a lot of patience.Barbecuing can be done in two methods: through grilling and smoking. Grilling is the quickest method of cooking meat over a direct source of dry heat, whereas, smoking is a slow process, where the food is kept at a particular distance from the fire. Now let us take the two separately, to know the real processing.\n\nBBQ Grilling\n\nGrilling is of two types: direct and indirect. But before going into the details,let me tell you that there are three varieties of grills: charcoal grill, gas grill and electric grill. Charcoal grills are relatively inexpensive when compared to the other two. Now we’ll go back to the types of cooking. Direct method is a high heat method and is used for cooking relatively small pieces of food. Steaks, chops, chicken breasts,etc are some of the typical foods that can be grilled directly. In indirect method, as the name suggests, the food is kept to the side of the heat source. It is somewhat like baking a cake or such type of foods.Now we will move on to smoking.\n\nBBQ Smoking\n\nSmoking is the finest way to cook food,even though it takes time. If grilling is best for cooking smaller pieces, smoking is best for cooking larger pieces. Roasts, ham, ribs, brisket, etc are some of the foods that can be smoked. One must maintain a steady temperature, to come up with a deliciously smoked food. The normal,suited temperature for smoking is between 200-225 degrees. If you cook the meat until it’s 165 degrees in the middle, it would make the meat more tastier,as the smoke flavour gets deep into it.For basic bbq smoking, you can use the regular grill. The only thing that one must be aware while smoking is, the selection of right type of wood.Because, each wood is different in its own way. So we have to experiment with all sorts of wood to find out which one is the best. Smokers may vary in shapes and sizes.There are smokers running in gas and charcoal.But the heat coming from any type of smoker is a cooler one,which is why it takes a lot of time to smoke.\n\nNow to end with it, barbecuing has to undergo one more process, that’s topping it with sauce.In fact it is the topmost ingredient, which one can’t omit while barbecuing.Types of sauce varies according to the region. If vinegar-base sauce is typical in Southern United States, tomato-base sauce is typical in Western United States. The best time to apply sauce is during the last stage of cooking. ie, when you are sure that the meat is well cooked,because,sugar is one of the main ingredients in barbecue sauces and it tends to burn easily. So you must cook the meat before you burn the sugar."},{title:"Gas Grill Burners Getting To Know You",body:"The cast brass and cast stainless steel burners have the smallest burrs — by far. This will mean less chaos in the gas flow, fewer trapped particulate matter in the burner and a cleaner burning grill. The following comparison shows how the ports are formed.\n\nWhy is port formation important? Several reasons. If the hole is punched into a sheet metal burner, it leaves a large tab inside the burner that will cause more chaos while burning. It is more apt to hold trapped food particles and grease, and is therefore more likely to burn through. (Note the Alfresco burner photo below.)\n\nMolded ports in cast burners seem like they would be a good idea, but there is considerable difficulty in making them uniform. Thus, it is quicker and less expensive to drill.\n\nDrilled ports are the most uniform and the most precisely placed. They tend to leave a burr on the inside of the burner, which is more noticeable (oddly enough) in a sheet metal burner. Cast burners tend to have smaller burrs.\n\nFire Magic grill burner has drilled orifices Notice (from the photo on our site) the lack of extensive burring, allowing for a smooth flow of gas. Cast stainless leaves few, if any, burrs when drilled. This burner has a lifetime warranty, including against rust and burn-through.\n\nNotice the placement of the ports: on the side, safely below the ridge. This placement will help prevent grease from dripping into the burner, minimizing the possibility of grease entering the burner.\n\nLynx grill burner is drilled\n\nNotice (from the picture on our site) the lack of extensive burring, allowing for a smooth flow of gas. Cast brass is similar to cast stainless steel when drilled, leaving few, if any, burrs. This burner carries a lifetime warranty, including against rust and burn-through. It is also interesting to note that Lynx does not offer a replacement burner for any of their grills: simply, you’ll never need one.\n\nOrifice placement is not as good with this burner as with the Fire Magic, but when you consider that you’ll never replace this burner, it probably doesn’t matter all that much.\n\nAlfresco grill burner has punched orifices\n\nPunched ports like these create substantial ledges where carbon particles and moisture can collect and foster burn-through. This burner has a limited lifetime warranty that only covers manufacturer’s defect. With this design, this burner *will* burn through, and faster than most other burners on the market.\n\nFurther, notice the placement of the ports: at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock; if any grease were to drip onto this burner, it is almost guaranteed to enter these ports, thereby compounding the rust and burn-through issue.\n\nDCS grill burner has drilled orifices\n\nAt least DCS drills burner ports. The burrs, however, are substantial when compared to cast stainless steel, and these will also collect particulates and moisture, which will foster burn-through. This burner also has a limited lifetime warranty that covers manufacturer’s defects only, not rust or burn-through.\n\nThis burner has a thicker steel than the Alfresco, but it also has a serious design flaw: the ports are drilled directly on top. If grease were to drip on this burner, it is guaranteed to enter the burner, compounding the rust and burn-through issue!"},{title:"Quick And Easy Lunches For The Cooking Challenged",body:"Let’s face it, cooking is not a top priority in the lives of every man, woman, or child on the planet. In fact, far too people have made learning to cook a priority in their lives. This means that we often exist on convenience foods and boxed mixes rather than taking the effort to prepare healthy meals for our families and our own personal enjoyment. The same holds true for lunches when we often resort to a can of soup or box of macaroni and cheese or some other such product rather than putting our creative efforts into making a quick and easy yet delicious lunch. You will see many ideas in this article and the hope is that these ideas will not only get you off to a great start for ending the lunch rut we all seem to find ourselves in at some time or another but also to try new things on your own. First of all, not all great lunches require actual cooking in order to prepare. Some of them will require the use of the microwave and some of them will need to be cooked or at least prepared before hand and reheated. The choices are virtually limitless once you understand the creative concept that must be in place. You should also find that many of these ideas are so simple you will wonder why on earth you have never thought of them. I certainly hope that some of these ideas will become main features within your own home. Lettuce wraps. These mike delightfully delicious lunch treats and the filling can be prepared ahead of time, which leaves only reheating the filling and wrapping when you’re ready to eat. This is a fun lunch to share with your little ones and it teaches them that lettuce is much more versatile than people often give it credit for being. Some people choose to go with a teriyaki inspired filling; my family likes taco inspired fillings for our lettuce rolls. You are perfectly free to come up with a favorite filling of your very own. Try sandwiches with different breads. Believe it or not, my children love trying new things. It’s a rare trait for which I am extremely grateful. Believe me I understand all too well how fortunate I am. My youngest however, has a little difficulty with thick or crusty bread. Her favorite sandwich choice has become Hawaiian sweet rolls. We put the meat, cheese, mustard, and pickle in her roll as if it were a bun and she’s thrilled. Other great ideas include hollowing out crusty rolls and filling them with roast beef and cheddar. You can broil this in your oven for a few minutes for a rare sandwich treat. The cooking part is very minimal and you do not have to have in depth knowledge of anything to prepare or enjoy these simple treats. Other great bread ideas include croissants with ham and cheese or chicken salad, taco pitas (another great favorite in our household), and paninis (this works really well if you have a George Foreman grill or a panini press). While this is by no means the end all be all guide to cooking quick and easy lunches it is good food for thought. The hope is that this will get your own creative juices flowing so that you can prepare wonderful lunches for your family without needing to do too terribly much heavy cooking in the process."},{title:"Beryl Cook S Art Quirky Uk Artist",body:"Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing artists .Beryl’s pictures feature women of all shapes and sizes enjoying themselves .Born between the two world wars, Beryl Cook eventually left Kendrick School in Reading at the age of 15, where she went to secretarial school and then into an insurance office.

Believe it or not, there is technique involved. It’s not just a matter of following your cooking instincts. \n\nOne of the main secrets of knowing exactly how to make a beautiful, tasty meal every time is knowing how and when to use high heat or very hot coals.\n\nThough you may have heard the term “seal in the juices” when it came to barbequing, you may even have tried some techniques every now and then, but unless you’re doing it properly, you won’t be getting it right. For the best results, many barbeque chefs cook vegetables and medium-rare steaks by first using a high heat in order to sear the outside of the food and seal both the juices and the flavors inside. \n\nThough this technique is good for foods that you don’t want to cook thoroughly, it shouldn’t be overused. If you’re cooking a meat such as hamburgers or pork ribs, they must be cooked all the way through in order to avoid bacterial contamination. Therefore, searing them to seal in the juices doesn’t do anything but give you dry, or charred food.\n\nThis can be explained by understanding the way that meat cooks on a barbeque. As it is heated, the cells and the fibers of the meat will tighten, squeezing out much of the juices. Therefore, if you’re only cooking a meat partially, searing it will help to seal in the juices by quickly cooking the outer layers of the food. However, if you should leave the food on this high heat, the inner layers will cook too quickly, vaporizing all of your precious and tasty juices. Try the technique a few times until you get it right. Pay attention to what you’re doing, so that when you do accomplish the right technique, you know how to repeat it.\n\nWhen you are using high heat, the rule of thumb is to cook on each side for a maximum of five minutes (a total of ten minutes). After ten minutes, anything that you’re cooking should be moved aside to a medium heat so that it can finish cooking at that lower temperature.\n\nThere are many ways to recognize how hot your fire really is, to make sure that it’s always perfect for any kind of food that you’re cooking on your barbeque. One of the most common tests is simply to hold your hand a couple of inches away from the grill. If you’re only able to keep it there for about a second, your grill is at a high heat (that is, over 600      "},{title:"Barbeque Techniques Two Methods To Consider",body:"When it comes to barbequing, there are two main schools of thought for the techniques that you can use. \n\nThe first of these techniques – and the most popular method for those who grill in their back yards – is the style where the food is cooked directly over the source of heat. This way, the food is rapidly cooked on a hot grill suspended directly over the charcoals, the wood, or the gas burners. Rarely is the lid ever closed. Any foods, including the most tender cuts, hamburgers, steaks, kabobs of all kinds, chicken, and even vegetables are quickly seared and cooked to perfection using this technique. If sauces are desired, they can be added before hand, during the cooking process, or even after the food comes off the grill. These choices will all create different and enjoyable tastes and flavors.\n\nThe second barbeque cooking technique uses heat indirectly. This is more appropriate when you’re cooking much larger or whole cuts of meat, such as especially thick steaks, roasts, a whole hog, or a pork shoulder. When you’re cooking using this method, the food is cooked away from the actual source of heat. This usually requires a water pan of some kind in order to maintain the moisture level of the food. The temperatures generally sit in around 250      "
},{title:"Types Of Cookware Pots And Pans",body:"Pots and pans make the most essential part of your cookware. There are lots of various types available for each particular cooking method or a few different methods.\n\nSkillet/frying pan has a flat bottom with short sides that are flared or sloped, which makes it easier to toss and turn food with a spatula. The pan is usually made of a responsive to heat material such as lined copper, stainless steel with a copper or aluminum core, anodized aluminum or cast iron. Non-stick surface is also popular in such pans. They are available in different sizes and generally come with a cover.\n\nRoasting pan is usually of a rectangular shape with low sides allowing the heat from the oven to expose the entire surface of the meat. Roasting pan is generally used with a rack to prevent the meat from sitting in its own juices and stewing instead of browning. The pans are available made of different materials including stainless steel, aluminum with non-stick surface, clay and granite.\n\nSaucepan is a round pot with high straight sides and a flat bottom, can be used for several purposes, such as cooking soup, stewing vegetables, making sauces. There are a few styles to suit special purposes. A saucepan known as a Windsor has sides that flare out and another known as a saucier has sides that are rounded. There are also different sizes and materials of saucepans. Most of them have a snug fitting cover.\n\nStir-fry pan is a round, deep pan that may have straight sides with a slightly rounded base or more commonly a round base that slopes out and upward. Sizes and handle length can vary to match the cooking process. Heat is evenly distributed across the base while the sloping sides make it easier to stir and turn the ingredients.\n\nWok is a bowl shaped version of stir-fry pan, best for quick cooking food over high heat. It is available with rounded or flat bottom. Some varieties of woks have one long handle, some have two short handles and others have a long handle on one side and a short one on the opposite side. The materials used are carbon steel, cast iron, and metals with non-stick coating.\n\nStockpot is a deep, tall, straight-sided pot with two big, loop handles. It is used for simmering large amount of liquid, such as stock, soup and stews, but also works well for thick soups, chili and for boiling pasta. Sometimes comes along with pasta insert – made of stainless steel perforated insert that fits inside a stockpot and acts as a colander for draining pasta.\n\nGrill pan is a heavy metal pan that consists of ridges spaced evenly across the bottom, that closely simulate the grilling process when cooking various meats and foods. Can be with shallow sides or with deeper sides similar to a frying pan. Many grill pans are made of cast iron and are available in different shapes and sizes.\n\nDouble boiler consists of two pans – one inside of the other. The bottom pan contains hot water and the top pan holds the ingredients that are being cooked. Generally used for making delicate sauces that have a tendency to separate if cooked on direct heat. Double boilers can be made of stainless steel, enameled steel, glass and aluminum.\n\nFondue pot is a type of cookware that consists of a pot with a heat source such as a portable cooking fuel or an electrical heating element placed directly below the pot that is used for a food preparation process known as fondues (“fondue” is a French term meaning “to melt”). The heat source melts or fully warms the contents (usually cheese, chocolate, wine or other ingredients) so that food can be dipped into the pot and either cooked or coated with its contents and eaten as an appetizer or part of a meal."},{title:"The Perfect Pot For Every Preparation",body:"When it comes to buying good cookware, there are a lot of different options.

Everything came in a gloopy sauce and seemed to taste the same, due to the overuse of monosodium glutamate, supposedly a flavour enhancer but in reality, nothing of the kind. Then in the 1980s a new breed of Chinese restaurant arrived (at least it took that long to reach the provinces) which provided lighter, tastier Chinese cooking demonstrating regional differences. There was one drawback, however, which was that this new type of restaurant was much more expensive than the original cheap ‘n tasteless ones. Consequently, I thought how nice it would be to cook Chinese food at home but I had no idea where to start until BBC TV came to my rescue in the shape of Ken Hom, the USA-born chef of Cantonese parents.\n\nKen presented Chinese cuisine in such an easily-understandable way, demonstrating techniques and suggesting alternative ingredients should the originals not be available in your local supermarket. The book which accompanied the series, Ken Hom’s Chinese Cookery became my bible and I still have my copy, pages stained with oil drips and smears of sauce.  To help you on your way to cooking Chinese food at home, I’m going to briefly describe the basic equipment, ingredients and techniques which you need to know so that you can produce some simple and tasty dishes. I hope you enjoy the article and that it inspires you to get cooking!\n\nEquipment\n\nAlthough there are many implements and pieces of equipment you can buy, to start on the road to cooking your own Chinese food, you really only need a good knife or two and a wok. Woks come in all shapes and sizes, they can be non-stick, flat-bottomed, they can even be electric these days but I still prefer my old carbon steel wok with it’s rounded bottom and one wooden handle. This is a Pau wok. These are readily available in Chinese supermarkets and are much less expensive than other varieties. There is one important task though, before you will be ready to cook with such a wok and that is to season it. You will need to scrub it with a cream cleaner to remove any residues of machine oil and dry it carefully. Put the wok on the hob over a low heat. Rub the inside of the wok with two tablespoons of cooking oil using kitchen towel. Let the wok heat slowly for 10 to 15 minutes then wipe the inside with more kitchen towel. The paper will come away black. Carry on coating, heating and cleaning off until the kitchen towel comes away clean. Your wok is now ready to use. After use, wash only in water without detergent and dry thoroughly over a low heat. You may also apply a little oil if you wish. This should prevent the wok from rusting but if it does develop rust, just scrub and season again.\n\nAs well as the wok, you will need a wok stand, particularly if you have an electric hob. This keeps the wok stable if you are using it for braising or deep frying.\n\nYou will also need something to stir with – any spatula, slice or slotted spoon will do – metal for a metal wok and plastic or wooden for a non-stick wok.\n\nIngredients\n\nBefore you rush out and buy up the whole Chinese section at the supermarket, bear in mind that some ingredients don’t keep well if left unused.  Just select something simple from your chosen cookery book and buy the things that you need for that then you can expand your selection as you progress through different dishes.\n\nSome common store-cupboard ingredients that you will almost certainly need are dark and light soy sauce, some sort of cooking oil and sesame oil, cornflour and rice wine or sherry. For more information, see my article Chinese Cooking – Ingredients and Equipment.\n\nTechniques\n\nStir-Frying\n\nThe most well known Chinese cooking technique is stir-frying. This is where your wok comes into its own as it’s shape and size (at least 14 inches diameter with deep sides) is ideal for quick cooking.  The secret to successful stir-frying is to have all your ingredients ready in advance.\n\nMeat should be cut according to the recipe but normally in thin strips. Vegetables likewise but in any event should be of similar shapes and sizes to ensure even cooking. Long thin vegetables such as spring onions, carrots or asparagus are often cut on the diagonal so that more surface area is exposed for quicker cooking. Measure out sauce ingredients – check the recipe – if they are all added to the dish at the same time, you can put them all in one small bowl. If cornflour is included, don’t forget to give it a good stir before adding to the other food.\n\nOnce you have everything prepared, heat your wok until it is very hot then add oil and using your chosen stirring implement ensure that the oil is evenly distributed over the surface of the wok. Before you add your ingredients. the wok should be so hot that it is almost smoking – this will prevent the food from being greasy. The exception to this is if you are flavouring your oil with garlic, chilli, spring onions, ginger or salt – these will burn if the oil is too hot.\n\nNow add your other ingredients in the order stated in the recipe and toss them over the surface of the wok ensuring that nothing rests in one place for too long and moving the food from the centre of the wok to the sides. I suggest that you wear an apron or other protective clothing for this operation as the food often spits due to the high temperature it is cooked at.\n\nDeep Frying\n\nYou can use your wok for deep frying but be very careful that it is safely balanced on its stand. Under no circumstances leave it unattended. Deep frying in a wok uses less oil than a deep fryer or saucepan but you may find these safer and easier to use.\n\nWhen deep frying, make sure that the oil is hot enough before adding ingredients or the food will end up very greasy. Test it by dropping in a small piece of prepared food or a cube of bread. If the oil bubbles up around what you dropped in then it’s hot enough. \n\nMake sure that food to be deep fried is dried thoroughly on kitchen paper or drained of its marinade before cooking otherwise it will spit.\n\nShallow Frying\n\nThis is the same as the Western technique. Fry food on one side, then the other and drain off any excess oil before adding sauce ingredients. A normal frying pan is fine for this.\n\nSteaming\n\nSteaming is widely used in Chinese cookery. You can use a bamboo steamer in a wok, a heat-proof plate placed on a rack in a wok or other large pan or you can use a normal European steamer.\n\nIf using a bamboo steamer or plate in a wok, bring about 2 inches of water to a simmer. Put your rack into the wok (if the bamboo steamer is big enough and will sit on the sides of the wok without being in the water, you don’t need a rack) and balance your plate or steamer of food on it. Put the lid on your steamer or wok and check occasionally to see if the water needs topping up (use water which is already hot).\n\nWhichever method you use, make sure that the food is above the water level and isn’t getting wet. As with Western cooking, braising is used for tougher cuts of meat and involves gentle cooking of meat and/or vegetables in flavoured stock. Red-braising is the technique where food is braised in a dark liquid such as soy sauce which gives the food a red/brown colour. This type of braising sauce can be frozen and re-used."},{title:"Cooking Recipes Anytime And Anywhere",body:"Have you ever known exactly what you want to cook but searched and searched through all of your cook books and had no luck finding that tender morsel that has been making your mouth water all day?

Fewer realize it can be used in to cook food and sterilize water.\n\nCooking With The Power of the Sun\n\nA solar oven is pretty much what it sounds like. It is used to cook food and sterilize water. Most people do not even know they exist, but they are an effective way to cook from both an economic and efficiency point of view. The basic idea with a solar cooking is to create a box like structure that the sun heats up dramatically. If you have sat in a car in rush hour during the summer, you know the sun can generate a lot of heat. Instead of cooking you in a car, a solar oven focuses on food. So, how do we cook with it? The box structure is created with dark paneling and then covered with a clear glass or plastic top after pots and food or water has been inserted. The structure is sealed. Much like a car, the sunlight beats through the clear top and heats the interior of the box. As the heat rises, it cooks the items inside. Yes, it produces more than enough heat to do the job. It really is as simple as that. There are three general types of solar ovens. A solar box works as described in the previous paragraph. A panel oven uses reflective surfaces to focus the sun on a pot to create heat and cook the material inside. A parabolic version is designed to focus the sunlight into the bottom of a concave area upon which sits pots. There are variations of these three forms, but all solar cooking designs are derived from these basic forms. While cooking with the sun is a fun and efficient, most people will never apply it in their home because of obvious design issues. At a cabin or when camping, however, it is a perfect solution."},{title:"Why Do Make Ahead Recipes Work So Well To Reduce Your Dinner Party Stress",body:"One of the “tricks” I find most useful for hosting stress-free dinner parties is to make some of the recipes ahead.

Here are some reasons:      	"},{title:"The Principles Of Scientific Cooking",body:"Proper cookery renders good food material more digestible. When scientifically done, cooking changes each of the food elements, with the exception of fats, in much the same manner as do the digestive juices, and at the same time it breaks up the food by dissolving the soluble portions, so that its elements are more readily acted upon by the digestive fluids. Cookery, however, often fails to attain the desired end; and the best material is rendered useless and unwholesome by a improper preparation. It is rare to find a table, some portion of the food upon which is not rendered unwholesome either by improper preparatory treatment, or by the addition of some deleterious substance. This is doubtless due to the fact that the preparation of food being such a commonplace matter, its important relations to health, mind, and body have been overlooked, and it has been regarded as a menial service which might be undertaken with little or no preparation, and without attention to matters other than those which relate to the pleasure of the eye and the palate. With taste only as a criterion, it is so easy to disguise the results of careless and improper cookery of food by the use of flavors and condiments, as well as to palm off upon the digestive organs all sorts of inferior material, that poor cookery has come to be the rule rather than the exception. Methods of cooking.\n\nCookery is the art of preparing food for the table by dressing, or by the application of heat in some manner. A proper source of heat having been secured, the next step is to apply it to the food in some manner. The principal methods commonly employed are roasting, broiling, baking, boiling, stewing, simmering, steaming, and frying. Roasting is cooking food in its own juices before an open fire. Broiling, or grilling, is cooking by radiant heat. This method is only adapted to thin pieces of food with a considerable amount of surface. Larger and more compact foods should be roasted or baked. Roasting and broiling are allied in principle. In both, the work is chiefly done by the radiation of heat directly upon the surface of the food, although some heat is communicated by the hot air surrounding the food. The intense heat applied to the food soon sears its outer surfaces, and thus prevents the escape of its juices. If care be taken frequently to turn the food so that its entire surface will be thus acted upon, the interior of the mass is cooked by its own juices. Baking is the cooking of food by dry heat in a closed oven. Only foods containing a considerable degree of moisture are adapted for cooking by this method. The hot, dry air which fills the oven is always thirsting for moisture, and will take from every moist substance to which it has access a quantity of water proportionate to its degree of heat. Foods containing but a small amount of moisture, unless protected in some manner from the action of the heated air, or in some way supplied with moisture during the cooking process, come from the oven dry, hard, and unpalatable. Boiling is the cooking of food in a boiling liquid. Water is the usual medium employed for this purpose. When water is heated, as its temperature is increased, minute bubbles of air which have been dissolved by it are given off. As the temperature rises, bubbles of steam will begin to form at the bottom of the vessel. At first these will be condensed as they rise into the cooler water above, causing a simmering sound; but as the heat increases, the bubbles will rise higher and higher before collapsing, and in a short time will pass entirely through the water, escaping from its surface, causing more or less agitation, according to the rapidity with which they are formed. Water boils when the bubbles thus rise to the surface, and steam is thrown off. The mechanical action of the water is increased by rapid bubbling, but not the heat; and to boil anything violently does not expedite the cooking process, save that by the mechanical action of the water the food is broken into smaller pieces, which are for this reason more readily softened. But violent boiling occasions an enormous waste of fuel, and by driving away in the steam the volatile and savory elements of the food, renders it much less palatable, if not altogether tasteless. The solvent properties of water are so increased by heat that it permeates the food, rendering its hard and tough constituents soft and easy of digestion. The liquids mostly employed in the cooking of foods are water and milk. Water is best suited for the cooking of most foods, but for such farinaceous foods as rice, macaroni, and farina, milk, or at least part milk, is preferable, as it adds to their nutritive value. In using milk for cooking purposes, it should be remembered that being more dense than water, when heated, less steam escapes, and consequently it boils sooner than does water. Then, too, milk being more dense, when it is used alone for cooking, a little larger quantity of fluid will be required than when water is used. Steaming, as its name implies, is the cooking of food by the use of steam. There are several ways of steaming, the most common of which is by placing the food in a perforated dish over a vessel of boiling water. For foods not needing the solvent powers of water, or which already contain a large amount of moisture, this method is preferable to boiling. Another form of cooking, which is usually termed steaming, is that of placing the food, with or without water, as needed, in a closed vessel which is placed inside another vessel containing boiling water. Such an apparatus is termed a double boiler. Food cooked in its own juices in a covered dish in a hot oven, is sometimes spoken of as being steamed or smothered. Stewing is the prolonged cooking of food in a small quantity of liquid, the temperature of which is just below the boiling point. Stewing should not be confounded with simmering, which is slow, steady boiling. The proper temperature for stewing is most easily secured by the use of the double boiler. The water in the outer vessel boils, while that in the inner vessel does not, being kept a little below the temperature of the water from which its heat is obtained, by the constant evaporation at a temperature a little below the boiling point. Frying, which is the cooking of food in hot fat, is a method not to be recommended Unlike all the other food elements, fat is rendered less digestible by cooking. Doubtless it is for this reason that nature has provided those foods which require the most prolonged cooking to fit them for use with only a small proportion of fat, and it would seem to indicate that any food to be subjected to a high degree of heat should not be mixed and compounded largely of fats."},{title:"Healthy Cooking Is A Must For Families",body:"When it comes to cooking healthy meals for our families, there is always some degree of dissention among the ranks. The good news is that there are recipes that are very healthy but the healthy nature of these recipes is somewhat disguised. What they do not know in these instances truly should not bring harm their way (outside of allergies, which should never be ignored). Healthy cooking is often difficult as most of us do not want to spend time planning and preparing meals that our families refuse to eat. At the same time, we want our families to be healthy so we feel compelled to learn new and improved ways of cooking healthy foods for our family to enjoy (and unfortunately in some cases scorn). With weight and nutrition being known as the culprit in so many health conditions it is impossible to ignore the importance of not only eating healthy ourselves but also of teaching our children the importance of eating healthy. One way to insure that your loved ones are in fact eating healthy is to make sure that you are cooking healthy and nutritious foods for them. This does not mean that you cannot enjoy the occasional calorie splurge or even that you shouldn’t. The key to cooking healthy is learning to control portions and understanding the importance of moderation. For those that are hoping to incorporate healthy cooking habits into their daily routines, there are no more resources available than ever before in order to assist you in those endeavors. You can seek the services of a professional nutritionist, your doctor can offer advice, you can find all kinds of books on healthy eating, cooking, and living at your local library, and the Internet is an outstanding source of all kinds of information when it comes to leading a healthier lifestyle all around. There are many books and magazines that are filled with recipes that encourage healthy cooking and eating habits. If you truly love to cook, then there is no shortage of recipes that you can try out along the way. The really good news is that you can incorporate healthy cooking into your cooking routine whether you are cooking for one or a household of ten. There are many that will argue that cooking healthy food costs more than cooking the prepackaged foods that pack on the calories and additives. The truth of the matter is that when you compare the costs with the medical bills of the future for failing to do so, they seem rather slight by comparison. Yes, good food costs more money. In many cases, that is a simple fact of life. However, by learning portion control and eating the proper portions you just may discover that you are actually spending less as you adjust to the proper amounts of food you should be consuming in order to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. Cooking healthy isn’t an overnight change; it is a lifestyle change that should be implemented one step at a time. You do not have to go into your kitchen and through out every little thing that you deem ‘unhealthy’ only work to not buy more of these items once they’ve been used. Make wiser decisions when purchasing fats for food preparation and you will discover that you’ve made a vitally important step in the process of incorporating healthy cooking and eating habits in your home. It’s those small steps you take towards your goal of cooking healthy foods for your family that will matter far more than any giant leap. Before you know it you will find that you all have more energy and a better sense of overall health than you would have imagined before changing your cooking habits.

However, all too frequently, people are falling victims to very common barbeque myths. It’s not because we’re gullible or stupid in any way. Many barbeque myths are so well known and so wide spread that they are more frequently passed on as truth than they are as the myths that they truly are.\n\nFor example, many people love to try to get perfect grill lines on their barbequed foods. Either straight lines, or the more fancy criss-crossed ones are often accepted as a sure sign of the expert barbeque chef. What this involves is flipping your meat, so that the lines are on the both sides. However, many people don’t ever get to achieve this art form because they have fallen victim to one of the main barbeque myths. They believe that flipping or poking your grilled food makes it tough – this is a myth. In fact, flipping your meat not only creates great grill lines, but it also makes certain that you cook more evenly.  While you read up on the swath of information available for providing tips and tricks for the best results on your barbeque, make sure that your source is reliable. While some of this information is very helpful, much of it can be exaggerated or based on what the author “thinks” rather than what is actually known.\n\nThe belief that poking or flipping your food will let all of the juices out and make it tough would only work if your food was shaped exactly like a balloon – which it isn’t. Meat is made up of hundreds of small cells, each filled with its own moisture and juices. Should you poke your meat with a fork while it’s on the grill, you may pop one or two cells, but it won’t let all of the juices out…only that of the cells you’ve punctured. Certainly, if you repeatedly stab and puncture your meat, many of the cells will be broken, and you’ll lose a great deal of your juices, but other than in a horror movie, there really isn’t any reason to treat your meat that way.\n\nSimilarly, flipping your meat doesn’t let a great deal of the juices out either. After all, flipping doesn’t puncture any of the cells, so as long as you don’t flip it and smack it hard, then you won’t lose much by the way of juices at all. Be gentle…it’s already dead!\n\nThe problem with flipping your meat on the grill lies when cooks use their spatulas and other tools to squish the meat after it has been flipped, often trying to squeeze out the grease. By flattening the cells in the meat, much of the moisture and juices are pushed out, leaving the meat dry.\n\nSo flip those burgers and poke that steak! Get those grill lines just the way you want them. Your food will always be good and juicy, just like the pros do it."

Today, home chefs can explore new taste sensations by using spices and other flavorful ingredients to add a new world of flavor to fresh fish and seafood. “There’s nothing like the fresh flavors of herbs and spices for cutting unhealthy calories without sacrificing taste,” said Red Lobster Executive Chef Michael LaDuke, who offers the following simple tips for enhancing the natural flavor of fresh fish and seafood: World of Flavors: An easy recipe that turns fresh fish into an exotic dish is topping tilapia with a mixture of soy sauce, lime juice, orange juice, fresh ginger, garlic and cilantro. To produce a richer flavor, make the soy sauce mixture at least 24 hours in advance and refrigerate the sauce overnight. Serve the sauce at room temperature or slightly warmed. With its sweet, mild taste and firm, flaky texture, tilapia will soak up the flavors and take on a deliciously Asian flair. If you prefer a delicately flavorful fish such as halibut, complement its medium-to-firm texture with bold spice blends such as curry or chili. Healthy Oils: The key to making flavorful oils for a simply elegant and heart-healthy meal is to add herbs and spices, such as basil, garlic, salt and pepper, to olive oil over a low heat on the stove, similar to making tea. This allows you to adjust the intensity of the flavor. After heating the olive oil, strain the mixture and remove the herbs and spices. For a special touch, place the olive oil on your table surrounded by sprigs of the fresh herbs and spices.\n\nBe adventurous! Add a variety of flavorful herbs and spices to your oil mixture, such as exotic peppers, chives, dill, lemongrass or mint. If you serve olive oil over salmon, you’ll also enjoy the heart-health benefits of essential omega-3 fatty acids found in this delicious fish. Cooking With Wine: Wine is not only good for drinking, it’s also great for cooking. Pour white wine, such as a Sauvignon Blanc, over a firm white fish like mahi-mahi and season it with chili powder to intensify the flavor. Mahi-mahi is light enough to bring out the crisp citrus taste of this popular wine. But remember, your sauce will be only as good as the wine you choose, so always cook with a wine you enjoy drinking.\n\nAdding Some Zest: Add the tangy flavor of citrus by generously squeezing lemon, lime, orange or grapefruit juices over your favorite fish or seafood and garnishing with freshly grated zest. When using fruit zests as a garnish, it is best to slightly poach them beforehand in sugar water, as raw zests can taste bitter.\n\nFor quick, tasty meals, make a citrus butter ahead of time by combining melted butter and citrus juices, cooling the mixture and storing it in the refrigerator until ready to use. Citrus juices mixed with melted butter also make great dipping sauces for succulent lobster and shrimp.\n\nStudies show eating fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, including mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon, at least twice a week is good for the heart. Using an array of herbs and spices offers endless opportunities to bring out the best in all varieties of fresh fish and seafood.\n\nRed Lobster serves guests fresh fish entrees with bold flavors, savory seafood dishes that include shrimp, crab and scallops, as well as the company’s signature, live Maine lobster."},{title:"Cooking For Special Occasions",body:"We all have those moments in our lives when we feel as if everything needs to be exactly right.

This means that you will not run the all too common disaster scenarios that you hear about and will still manage to have a wonderful meal that is enjoyed by all. The trick is in choosing a rather simple meat dish and dressing it up with the more decadent side dishes. Incredibly rich side dishes that are simple to prepare are greater in number than meat dishes that require little culinary effort. You should also keep in mind the audience for your special occasion. Sometimes a family favorite makes the occasion seem much more special than an all out effort for chicken cordon bleu or veal Marsala. There is no point in going to an extreme effort to create a culinary masterpiece if it is going to be riddled with picky children proclaiming that they do not like this or that about your meal.\n\nAnother great idea when it comes to cooking for special occasions is to prepare as much as possible ahead of time in order to alleviate the pressure during the event and to allow you more time to enjoy the event rather than dealing with the details of meal preparation. The greatest gift you can really give yourself when cooking for special occasions is the time necessary in order to enjoy these special occasions. This is not to say that there isn’t some cooking that will need to be done. Foods that can be prepared ahead of time and reheated just prior to serving are often the best when it comes to cooking for special occasions. There are all kinds of appetizers, entrees, and desserts that will work perfectly in this particular instance. You can often find them by performing a simple Google search online or by sorting through many of your favorite cookbooks at home. The important thing is that you do not get so caught up in the idea of cooking for special occasions that you forget to actually enjoy the occasion. If this is not the way you prefer to do things that is perfectly understandable. Some of us do thrive in high stress situations. The key for those who prefer to do all the meal preparation when cooking for special occasions at the time of cooking is planning properly and allowing plenty of time for possible hiccups in the process. Mistakes occur when people feel rushed and hurried in their culinary efforts. Another common mistake that is made when cooking for special occasions is cooking outside of your comfort zone. When you are preparing a challenging recipe it is best if you do this during a time when you are not going through the stress of potential visitors or insuring the best possible of circumstances. In other words, it is best to challenge your culinary talents when you do not have a vested interest in success. Special occasions are a great time for friends and family. The hope is that you will have many special occasions throughout your life. Do not waste too much time and energy fretting over cooking for special occasions. Instead, put all of your effort into enjoying those occasions."},{title:"Stocking Your Restaurant Kitchen Finding Reliable Sellers Of Cookware In The Brick And Mortar World",body:"If you are a culinary fan, if you like to spend time in your kitchen, you likely find yourself looking for reliable resources through which you can make the purchase of cookware products in the brick and mortar world.

For many, grilling becomes a routine mealtime activity, while for the most devoted grillers, summer is ruled by massive barbecue parties. But grillers do not have to choose between boring repetition and outrageous get-togethers: every barbecue can and should be an exciting family event. Here are 5 ways to make your routine evening barbecue a more unique experience: 1) Who said you have to stick to meat? Much can be done with bread and fruits over an open flame. To make this into a fun activity with your kids, use cookie cutters to make the bread and fruit into shapes. You can decide on themes like “animals” and “letters” or ask that each shape be different from the others! Then, let your kids decide which toppings they would like to put on. Add cheese, onion and various spices to bread and cinnamon and honey to fruit. 2) Try foil-wrapped surprise meals. Place different combinations of chicken, fish and vegetables with sauces and spices in foil packets. These cook in less than 20 minutes and lead to no-mess, lip-smacking results. Children will love the surprise element and can easily switch packets. You can even ask your family for combo suggestions before the barbecue, or draw ingredient names out of a hat to create new meal ideas. \n\n3) A little variety goes a long way. If you tend to stick to the same old beef burgers and pork wieners, why not try grilled pizza or salmon steaks? Similarly, try to mix it up with condiments and seasoning. Sick of ketchup? Try salsa instead. Look online where you’ll find hundreds of easy recipes for barbecue rubs. These give your food that extra pizzazz and prevent the mess and drip that comes with barbecue sauces. 4) Barbecues don’t have to be rushed. In fact, barbecue devotees will tell you that today’s quick broiling is an insult to the term, which should represent a process of slow cooking on low heat. You can find many slow cooker recipes online, and the wait is a great opportunity to pass some quality time with your family and friends. Entertaining backyard activities include creating an outdoor canvas to paint on or playing backyard bowling with household items. \n\n5) Mom said not to play with your food, but there’s always an exception! Barbecue games are great fun and tasty at the same time. In the game Glutton, each player gets a certain amount of mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese or any other side dish. Various kitchen utensils are put in a box and the players blindly pick a few. On the go, they begin to eat their dish with the items that they took out. The first to finish his or her food wins the prize! Finally, don’t fret! Far too many people get lost in the details of planning the perfect barbecue party and forget to enjoy the social atmosphere and delicious food. So kick back, bask in the relaxing sun and prepare for a summer of unforgettable barbecues!"},{title:"Save Money The Crock Pot Way",body:"Saving money – is something we would all like to do. Whether you are struggling to manage day to day or earning a six figure salary, saving is something we all think about.\n\nThere is one thing we can all save on. The one thing we all do, every day, several times a day.\n\nWe all … Eat. And food these days can be so expensive. It is quite easy to go to the grocers and spend your entire weeks pay just on food. Meat especially can put a hole in anyone’s budget. After a long day at work, the last thing you want is to spend the rest of the day in the kitchen preparing dinner. So the quick option is often just to fry or grill up some steak. But this is expensive. And frying those cheaper cuts of meat – ugh! You have heard the old saying ‘tough as old boots’. They end up so tough, that even if you do manage to eat them; you will be lucky not to chip a tooth or dislocate a jaw; both of which cost even more.\n\nHow about if you could save money on your food bill and save hours in the kitchen at the same time?\n\nWell the solution for you is . . . the Crock Pot.\n\nIt allows you to turn those cheap meat cuts into not only edible, but absolutely delicious meals. And, does it all, while you are at work.\n\nThis is not some new gimmicky thing you see in info-commercials on late night television. This is a real kitchen appliance that has been around since the early 1970’s.\n\nIt uses low heat and a slow cooking method which tenderizes the meat. Just put the vegetables and meat in the pot in the morning on the way to work and come home to the delightful aroma of dinner ready in the evening.\n\nSave money – the cheapest meat cuts are the best ones to use, they are full of flavor and appreciate the long cooking time. \n\nLisa – “The Crock Cook”"},{title:"Beat The Summer Heat With Crock Pot Cooking",body:"When the weather outside warms up, the kitchen can be a terrible place to be. There are many things you can do however, when it comes to cooking a nice home made meal that doesn’t require traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn to utilize some of the lesser heat producing equipment in your kitchen, such as the crock pot, in order to truly beat the summer heat and keep your cool while preparing a nice hot meal for friends and family.\n\nSo, how does crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? Simply put, the crock pot in and of itself puts off far less heat when cooking than an oven or stove top. This is the first and possibly the best reason to utilize the crock pot in your summer meal planning. You should also consider the fact that by not heating the house by using your stove top or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or other cooling methods) from working overtime in order to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking methods introduce. This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the costs involved in operating a crock pot are far less than the costs involved in operating a stove or oven in general. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven are often serious energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not raising the temperature in your home by traditional means of cooking and you are using even less electricity.\n\nUnfortunately for most, the general consensus has been that crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter meals. The truth is that the crock pot should be one of your best loved and most often utilized cooking methods if you can manage it. When it comes to cooking with a crock pot, the options are almost limitless. Almost anything that can be baked can be made in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing meals and treats as well.\n\nBenefits of Crock Pot Cooking\n\nIn addition to the cost benefits mentioned above when it comes to crock pot cooking there are many other benefits that are well worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work involved in crock pot cooking takes place early in the day when you are refreshed rather than at the end of a hectic work or play day. This means that you are less likely to forget an ingredient or make other mistakes that often occur as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are exhausted from the activities of our day.\n\nSecond, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is a meal in one dish. Another great reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is the ease of clean up. Unlike pots and pans, most crock pot meals are made in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for the first star.\n\nWhile there will never be a one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very close. If you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust if off, and dig up some great summertime crock pot cooking recipes."},{title:"The Almighty Beer Can Chicken",body:"A popular method of cooking chicken in recent years both in Barbeque contest as well as backyard barbeques is the beer-can chicken. Cooking a beer-can chicken couldn’t be any easier but the results are worthwhile. This is a technique that delivers a moist, succulent chicken and flavorful chicken. It’s also a bit of a showstopper and makes a lively conversation starter as well.  Is it chicken in a beer can? Close but try beer can in a chicken. The beer is used to both keep the bird flavorful and moist, and the cook happy. By the time the bird is ready to eat, the chef will not be the only one with a beer belly!\n\nIs it safe to eat chicken that has been in contact with the ink from a beer can? When the FDA was asked this question they were not sure because they have only tested the cans as a container and not as a cooking utensil. However the ink on the cans is applied at a temperature in excess of 500 degrees while the can never get hotter then 215 degrees during the cooking process. The conclusion by most is that there is nothing harmful in using the cans.\n\nFor those cooks who still worry about possible contamination, vertical stainless steel chicken roasters are available. These roasters have their own reservoir for beer, water or your choice of liquid. \n\n1 whole chicken 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 3 tablespoons of your favorite dry spice rub 1 can beer Preparing the chicken\n\nRemove and discard neck and giblets from chicken. Rinse chicken inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels. Rub or brush the chicken lightly with oil then season inside and out with salt, pepper and dry rub.\n\nOpen a can of beer and drink half. Wait 5 minutes then drink the other half and open a second can for the chicken. Drink half of the second beer and reserve remainder of beer for the bird. Using a “church key”-style can opener, pop a few more holes in the top of the can so that the moisture will be able to escape. \n\nWith the can on a steady surface, lower the chicken onto the can. It should stand on it’s own using the legs and can as a tri-pod. Refrigerate the bird while you get your grill or smoker setup.\n\nPreparing the grill\n\nWhether you intend to grill or smoke the bird, the goal is indirect heat. No coals or burner directly under the chicken. Place a drip pan under where you intend the bird to sit. If you are grilling, turn the burners to medium-high on one side of your grill and place the bird on the other side. \n\nCooking the chicken\n\nContinue to cook the chicken over medium-high with the grill cover on for approximately 1 1/4 – 1 1/2 hours. The chicken will be done when the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F in the breast area and 180 degrees F in the thigh. Remove from grill with tongs and move to cutting board. Be careful not to spill the beer when removing the can. Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before carving. Toss the beer can out along with the carcass."},{title:"How To Cook With Fresh Herbs",body:"Herbs are fun and easy to grow. When harvested they make even the simplest meal seem like a gourmet delight. By using herbs in your cooking you can easily change the flavors of your recipes in many different ways, according to which herbs you add. Fresh herbs are great in breads, stews, soups or vegetables. Every time you add a different herb you have completely changed the taste. If you are a beginner start slowly, add just a little at a time adjusting as you go along until you have it just right. You will see in most instances that an individual herb is associated with a particular food item. Basil is paired with tomatoes, Oregano with sauces, Rosemary with lamb and Chives with butter or cream cheese. Of course, none of them are limited to these items, but you will see them paired most often with that particular food. Use your imagination and experiment, experiment, experiment! You can make herb vinegars for salad dressings, marinades, or soups. Herb oils are very useful in cooking whenever a recipe calls for it. Fresh herbs as garnishes dress up any dish making it look truly spectacular. Lay individual sprigs of rosemary over broiled lamb chops. Chop fresh parsley and sprinkle it over the top of your potato salad. The combinations are endless and the outcome delicious. Fresh herbs will keep in the refrigerator for several days but then you must freeze them. They can be frozen by laying them a paper towel and putting them in a plastic bag. Once they are frozen only use them in cooking not as garnishes. A friend of mine washes them, puts them an ice cube tray, covers them with water and then freezes them. When she needs them for soup, stews or sauces she just drops a cube in. My favorite herbs to grow are basil, oregano, lemon balm, parsley and mint. Mint is great but be careful, mint can over run your garden. A tip here would be to bury an empty coffee can and plant the mint in it. The can prevents the mint from “creeping” all through your garden. I love to make herb butters. Take a half of a cup of softened butter and mix in about 4 tablespoons of a fresh herb. Lay out a piece of saran wrap, place the butter in the middle roll the saran wrap up to form a “log” out of the butter. Put in the refrigerator and anytime you need a pat of butter just cut it off the “log”. (Hints for “log” butter: potatoes, bread, steaks, noodles or any kind of sauce). A fresh herb in any salad dressing really makes it sparkle. You can use any herb or a combination, be creative. I learned a trick a long time ago using basil, lemon and avocados to create and instant natural face mask. Put a big handful of basil in a blender and run it on high. Once the basil has been pulverized, throw in a half of an avocado and a large teaspoon of lemon juice, mix until smooth. Wash your face, pat it dry and gently rub the avocado mixture on. Leave it on as long as you like, then use warm water to it wash off. These are just a few ways you can use fresh herbs from your garden. I am sure you will come up with many more.

In the United States alone, millions of people get a food-related illness each year.\n\n“Even the healthiest foods can make a person sick if they aren’t handled, cooked or stored properly,” says Dr. Robert Berkow, editor in chief of Your Health Now, a new health magazine from the global pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., Inc. Here are some tips on how to avoid getting sick:\n\n• Always wash hands before handling food. Illnesses are easily transferred from person to person through food. Washing hands before touching fruits, vegetables and other foods helps to kill any bacteria that may be transferred from the person’s hand to the food.\n\n• When handling raw meat, poultry or pork, always clean up thoroughly. Don’t just wash your hands but also clean the surfaces of cutting boards, countertops and utensils you use. The bacteria known as salmonella spreads easily on surfaces that come in contact with raw meat. • Avoid eating undercooked food. Undercooked beef, chicken and seafood increase a person’s chance of getting salmonella or E. coli, another type of bacteria. This can cause fever, cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. • Do not eat foods that contain raw eggs. Raw eggs may be contaminated with salmonella, which can be killed by cooking. When cooking, always throw away cracked or dirty eggs. • Avoid drinking juices that have not been pasteurized. The pasteurization process kills bacteria such as E. coli.\n\n• Avoid canned foods that are bulging or dented, or jars that are cracked. Lids should not be loose or swollen. Look at the “sell by” and “use by” dates. Avoid foods that will expire soon after purchasing and never buy outdated foods.\n\n• Properly store and refrigerate foods when they’re brought home. Cooked foods should not be left to stand at room temperatures for long periods before serving, and leftovers should be refrigerated within two hours.\n\n• When in doubt, throw it out. If you aren’t sure if that leftover is safe to eat, then toss it in the trash."},{title:"Perfect Scrambled Eggs",body:"The truth is that scrambled eggs are easy to make. Unfortunately, they are also the easy to make WRONG. At a root level, scrambled eggs are simply beaten eggs which are fried and – for lack of a better word – scrambled. But like most things that are simple (take love and martinis as examples), people have found ways to make them needlessly complex.\n\nNo cheese. No overt flavorings. Just eggs and what it takes to make them taste and look like great eggs.\n\nWhat NOT To Add\n\nCottage Cheese — Several recipes I encountered recommended whisking a Tablespoon of small curd cottage cheese in with each egg. Visually, the result was creamy and mildly fluffy scrambled eggs. In terms of taste, the cottage cheese did not contribute or detract from the eggs — but it did make the dish seem somehow impure. You knew there was something in there besides the egg. The aspect of cottage cheese that secured its fate as a stay-out-of-our-scramble ingredient was that no matter how vigorously you whisked the dish had texture irregularities. Every other bite had the unwelcome surprise of a noticeable cottage cheese curd.\n\nReal Cream – I tried two recipes that used real cream (“the fat skimmed off the top of raw milk” as defined by the Wikipedia Dairy Products Guide). One said to add 1 Tablespoon of real cream per egg.

The time could be better spent with your loved ones with everyone helping to get the food on the table. Another benefit of scratch cooking is that it allows you to better control the types of ingredients you consume.

For example, before baking muffins, breads or cookies, make sure you have checked your baking powerhouses-baking soda and baking powder, as well as spices, cornstarch and flour.

Cooking with wine has never been more popular and endless recipes abound that incorporate all different types of wine into favorite dishes and unique spins on classic cuisine. When you cook with Italian wine, the alcohol evaporates, so the dish will be appropriate for individuals unable to consume alcohol, underage eaters, or individuals who do not wish to imbibe any alcohol.\n\nMany international dishes include wine, especially Italian, French, and Spanish favorites. You can use any type of wine or alcohol to cook with, but Italian wine has substantial fan following when it comes to cooking with wine. Whether you want to add a unique flavor or a powerful zest to your dishes, adding your favorite Italian wine will have everyone raving over your cooking skills and the dishes you serve.\n\nThe key to cooking with wine is to choose good quality Italian wine. Just as quality directly affects the drinking enjoyment of a glass of Italian wine, the quality will also affect the end taste of dishes that are prepared using wine as an ingredient. Remember, quality wines are not necessarily the most expensive wines, so avoid associating price with taste. It is safe to say that if you enjoy drinking a particular vineyard’s wine, you will also enjoy cooking with the same wine. Also, you should carefully choose a Italian wine appropriate for the dish. Generally, the recipe you choose will come with the appropriate Italian wine included, but the traditional rules for serving wine with food applies to including the wine as ingredients with food. Many individuals choose to cook with white wine for a tangier, crisp taste and choose red wines for heartier dishes, including those filled with tasty cuts of meats.\n\nEven though water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, alcohol has a much lower boiling point, around 175 degree Fahrenheit. For this reason, you can quickly remove alcohol in Italian wine, in fact, approximately 40 percent of the alcohol is boiled out in approximately 15 minutes. Eventually, the Italian wine will turn into a thick syrup is boiled long enough. This syrup is perfect for use as a glaze with meats or vegetables.\n\nOnce the alcohol has been evaporated, the flavors are emphasized. Also, alcohol, including Italian wine, brings out the flavor of tomatoes and other ingredients. Consider adding a bit of white Italian wine to tomato sauces to bring out the flavors.\n\nThere are a variety of cooking wines on the market, but you should avoid these products, since they are of lower quality than a fine Italian wine and usually contain a high amount of sodium. However, if you are a collector of fine Italian wine, save these delicious drinks from the heat, since the alcohol will only be evaporated and the importance of the wine will be lost.

The correct microwave however, can actually brown and bake a full sized Thanksgiving turkey. Microwave cooking is definitely not something that is meant for those who are afraid of trying something new or those that are afraid of making mistakes along the way. This is a process that is one part science and one part figuring it out. Research helps a great deal but even many of the recipes you will find for microwave cooking are written for microwaves of varying wattage so you will need to ferret out what times and temperatures would be appropriate for your microwave.

They are a staple in the kitchen.\n\nAn egg can be cooked alone – boiled, poached, fried, scrambled.\n\nOr used as an ingredient in baking, batters and cakes.\n\nAlternatively use an egg to thicken sauces or to add air to lighten dishes.\n\nThe egg is truly amazing. And without it – well our menus sure would be dull.\n\nBut do you know much about the egg?\n\nChances are that you have never even given it a thought. Well it is time you did.\n\nThe most critical aspect of the egg is – it’s air content. (bet you thought I was going to say the shell).\n\nWhen first laid, the egg has barely any air inside a tiny air pocket. However, because the shell is porous, it allows air to penetrate. And as time passes, air moves inside the egg and the air pocket grows.\n\nAs this air pocket enlarges, the moisture in the egg evaporates. So, as the egg gets older the yolk becomes less plump and flatter and the white separates and spreads.\n\nAnd this all impacts on cooking. Depending on how you intend on using the egg determines how fresh an egg you should use.\n\nIf you fry an older egg, you will end with a flat ‘pancake’ instead of a neat rounded egg.\n\nThe more stale an egg the more fragile and difficult to separate it will be.\n\nAs opposed to the fresh egg, which has a tight and tough inner skin. This makes peeling the shell off the boiled egg very frustrating. As the egg ages with skin relaxes allowing the shell to peel much easier.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to have your own hens, then you know how old your eggs are. But what if you have to buy them?\n\nThe easiest method of tell how old an egg is, is to put the egg in a dish of water.\n\nIf it sinks and lies horizontally – very fresh.\n\nIf it sinks but tilts slightly – about 1 week old.\n\nIf it sinks but stands vertically – older, stale.\n\nBut if it floats – it’s off and be careful not to crack the shell.\n\nSome people prefer brown eggs and some white. But nutritionally they are the same.\n\nThe yolks will also vary in color depending of the diet of the hen.\n\nDo you find your eggs crack when boiling? Well, follow these simple steps to get perfect eggs, every time.\n\nUse 2 week old eggs and ensure they are at room temperature. Make as pin prick in the rounded flat end of the egg – this allows any steam that might build up to escape.\n\nUse as small a saucepan as possible, so the eggs fit in snuggly – you don’t want to much space otherwise they may bounce around and crack.\n\nBring to the boil but only simmer do not boil vigorously. Follow these tips and your eggs won’t crack.\n\nSo, for frying and poaching use as fresh an egg as possible. When the recipe calls for eggs to be separated, use fresh eggs as well. But if you want easy to peel eggs use the older ones. And when it comes to scrambling, fresher is best but older ones will do.

Chopped yolks and whites comprise Eggs Goldenrod and Polonaise Sauce. Whole hard-cooked eggs become comforting, familiar deviled eggs or zingy, newly rediscovered pickled eggs. Simply sprinkled with an herb or more fancily coated in sausage for Scotch eggs, hard-cooked eggs are nature’s own hand-held snack food. With a supply of hard-cooked eggs on hand, you’re ready for almost any meal occasion.\n\nHard-cooked eggs are often incorrectly called hard-boiled eggs. Yes, the cooking water must come to a boil. But, you’ll get more tender, less rubbery eggs without a green ring around the yolk and you’ll have less breakage if you turn off the heat or remove the pan from the burner, allowing the eggs to cook gently in hot water.\n\nVery fresh eggs may be difficult to peel. The fresher the eggs, the more the shell membranes cling tenaciously to the shells. The simplest method for easy peeling is to buy and refrigerate eggs a week to 10 days in advance of hard cooking. This brief “breather” allows the eggs to take in air which helps separate the membranes from the shell. 1. Place eggs in single layer in saucepan. Add enough tap water to come at least 1 inch above eggs.\n\n2. Cover. Quickly bring just to boiling. Turn off heat. 3. If necessary, remove pan from burner to prevent further boiling. Let eggs stand, covered, in the hot water about 15 minutes for Large eggs (12 minutes for Medium, 18 for Extra Large.)\n\n4. Immediately run cold water over eggs or place them in ice water (not standing water) until completely cooled. Once cooled, refrigerate eggs in their shells and use within one week of cooking or peel and use immediately.\n\n5. To remove shell, crackle it by tapping gently until a fine network of lines appears all over the shell.\n\n6. Roll egg between hands to loosen shell.\n\n7. Peel, starting at large end. Hold egg under running cold water or dip in bowl of water to help ease off shell. 8. To segment eggs evenly, use an egg slicer or wedger. For chopped eggs, rotate a sliced egg 90 degree in a slicer and slice again. Or chop eggs with a sharp pastry blender in a bowl. Draw down a wedger’s wires only partway to open an egg to hold a stuffing or resemble a flower."},{title:"Barbecue Party Tips For A Truly Amazing Event",body:"Barbecue party tips can help a host put together an extraordinary event for family and friends.

This way, all aspects of the party such as the food, games and decorations can be fashioned around a central theme. Favorite themes for barbecue parties include a Hawaiian motif, nostalgic seventies get-together, or, if you are near the sea, opt for a beach bbq party!\n\nPlanning the menu is perhaps the most important part of any get-together especially for a barbecue party as most guests will be looking forward to an array of lip-smacking roasted meats dripping in bbq sauce.\n\nBarbecue on the Beach Anyone?\n\nAh, what can be better than a great barbecue on the beach? The beach is definitely one of the best locations to have a barbecue. After all, the nature of grilling and barbecuing as a cooking technique is that it’s fun, exciting and very rewarding. Similarly, the beach pretty much exudes the same atmosphere. There are a lot of fun and exciting activities to do at the beach. It’s a place where people can be themselves in their ‘bare essentials’ and the relaxation factor is definitely rewarding. Putting these two wonderful concepts together, a barbecue on the beach is pretty much a recipe for a great time!\n\nBut before you pack your stuff, gear up your grill and hit the sand for one hell of a barbecue on the beach party, bear in mind that there are various safety procedures and other rules governing beach areas so it would be best to consult authorities and secure the proper permissions before you even think about organizing a beach barbecue party.\n\nAssuming you’ve done that and you’ve already picked a nice spot, next would be preparing for your barbecue on the beach. There are various grill types that you may use for barbecuing on the beach – you have the wood or charcoal grill, gas grill or you may also use a campfire tripod. Be sure to station your grill in a stable spot, away from any flammable material and safe from people possibly bumping into it.\n\nBring your marinated meat, poultry or seafood in a cooler and take them out only when you’re ready to start barbecuing to avoid spoilage. Further, the last seasoning you would want on your barbecue on the beach is sand right? So keep them covered!\n\nAnd of course, don’t forget to pack those barbecue sauces and hot sauces to spice up your barbecue dishes.

Despite this fact, we are seeing more and more recipe books and Internet websites that are dedicated to the act of cooking for one. Divorce and the death of spouses or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that someone accustomed to cooking for more than one would suddenly need to learn how to adjust all the cooking practices utilized before into a streamlined plan of cooking that is more efficient for one person creating less waste. The mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make cooking for one a challenge rather than a trial. Use this opportunity to try new and exciting cuisines. Perhaps one of the greatest things about cooking for one is the fact that it isn’t quite as expensive as cooking for two. This means that you have a little more money in the grocery budget with which to plan and prepare your meals. One thing you may want to keep in mind however is that when cooking for one, if you prepare foods that are freezable. It may save more time (and in the end money) if you cook the full 2-4 servings that most recipes call for and freeze the leftovers in single serving portions for a later point in time. This leaves you with a freezer full of foods for those nights when the thought of cooking just seems beyond your capabilities. This also leaves you with doing the work once and enjoying the fruits of your efforts many times over. This is a great position to be in if you ask me. We are finding more and more recipes and cookbooks that are designed around the concept of cooking for one. No matter what situation placed you in the position of cooking for one, there is no reason that you shouldn’t enjoy great food that is exciting and pleasant simply because you are dining alone. There is no harm in enjoying a fabulous meal with a glass of wine and great music whether you are cooking for one or one hundred. Remember you are what you eat and if you relegate yourself to boring meals that lack excitement and spice that is what you will become. However if you decide to reach out and try new and exciting dishes with every meal you prepare when cooking for one, it will show in the way you embrace life in other areas as well. While we should not live to eat, we should also not limit ourselves to eating to live. Enjoy the foods you prepare whether the portions are large or small in size. If you do not want to invest heavily in cookbooks that relate to cooking for one, it is quite possible that your local public library will have a few from which you can find some excellent recipes tips and resources. While you are there be sure to check out their selection of exotic food cookbooks in order to spice things up a bit. You never know what treasures you may discover on the shelves or your local library. You may even find local resources on classes that center on the idea of cooking for one.

Purchase ribs that are evenly covered in meat. In other words, don’t buy a slab that is fatty on one end and fleshy on the other. Avoid slabs that have exposed bones!\n\n2.	Allow for one pound of ribs per guest. This is a generous helping but for more impressive appetites, make it two!\n\n3.	When preparing the meat, make sure you remove the membrane on the underside of the ribs with a sharp knife. If you don’t it blocks the flavor intake.\n\n4.	Always marinate your ribs in the refrigerator, not at room temperature.\n\n5.	Don’t even think about boiling those ribs! Above all else, boiling the meat causes it to lose all its flavor. If you just have to pre-cook your ribs before slapping them on the cooking grate, try steaming your slabs instead as this will help lock the flavor in. 6.	Before placing your ribs on the grate for Barbecuing or smoking, make sure you coat the metal with a generous helping of oil.\n\n7.	Barbecuing demands constant attention! As soon as it goes on your grate, stay close by and keep an eye on it. Watch the cooking temperature and avoid going above 250 degrees Fahrenheit — the best ribs are cooked slowly over indirect heat for about five hours. 8.	Put down that fork! Always use tongs to handle your meat once it’s on the grate. Why pierce the meat and let the flavor ooze out if you don’t have to?\n\n9.	If you’re going to baste during cooking stay away from anything with sugar in it. Your best bet is to use vinegar and/or water-based products only.\n\n10.	Only lay on the BBQ sauce in the last 20-30 minutes of cooking. Any sooner than that and the heat will cause the sauce to caramelize and burn your meat.\n\n11.	Let the ribs cool for 10-15 minutes before you serve them up. This is just a courtesy — you don’t want to singe your guests’ mouths with smoking hot sauce! You could lose some friends."},{title:"Deep Fryer Pieces Of Wisdom",body:"For a time I worked in a convenience store as a clerk and cook and I used a deep fryer quite a bit for cooking battered chicken and French fried potatoes. \n\nOf course the chicken doesn’t start out battered. It comes delivered frozen in big cardboard boxes. Before the chicken is ready for the cooking part it must be prepared and time to thaw out. Each piece of chicken is rinsed in cold water, then put in a vat of tenderising, salty water to soak for several hours in a refrigerated area. It is again rinsed and kept cold, until needed for cooking. \n\nWhen needed for cooking the chicken is breaded in a special spicy flour mix, dipped in spice water, and breaded with mix again. Each piece is than carefully placed in the boiling oil in the deep fryer; starting with the large, meaty pieces, and finishing with the thin bony pieces. This gives the thick meaty pieces more time to cook. They get the hottest oil in the pot to start off the cooking process. The deep fryer is on a timer and part way through the cooking process the timer sets off an alarm which notifies you that it’s time to stir the chicken, so it gets all sides cooked evenly, even the sides touching when first put in the fryer. After stirring the chicken it cooks until the end of cooking cycle alarm goes off. Then the pot elevator will automatically lift the cooking basket out of the hot oil, allowing the chicken to drip off the excess oil. \n\nThe deep fryer also cooks French fried potatoes. After cutting the potatoes into the elongated cube shape in a cutter, the fries are battered, dipped and battered again. They then can be gently lowered in hands full, into the boiling oil. The cooking is again controlled by a timer, which sounds when the cooking cycle has completed.  After 4 cooks the oil in the fryer needs to be filtered to clean it for future cooking cycles. Another alarm indicates when oil filtering needs to occur.  The heat on the oil is turned off, so the oil can cool down enough to work with. The cooking basket is raised and removed from the fryer. A valve is turned to allow the oil to drain down into the filtering drawer. When the oil has drained the empty oil reservoir is brushed, including the heating coil element, to remove anything sticking to their surfaces. A pump is turned on which circulates the oil repeatedly through the filter. The filtering can take place for 10 or 15 minutes, depending how dark the oil appears in color. When the oil has become lighter in color it is pumped back up to the oil reservoir, after the valve at the bottom of the pot has been closed. The heating element is turned on and the oil is brought back up to cooking temperature. The unpleasant part is scooping out the sludge at the bottom of the filter drawer. Then the cleaned filter is dusted with a special powder, put back in its place under the fryer pot, and all is ready to go again.  Yes the fryer does most of the cooking for you but watch out for the hot oil when loading the food into the cooking basket. Even wearing rubber gloves won’t stop the oil from burning you, should it splash on your hands as the food drops into the hot oil. The secret is to be brave and gutsy. Get the food close to the oil before you drop it in. That way the splash is really small, and doesn’t jump up to fry your wrist. \n\nHappy cooking. Cook, but don’t be cooked."},{title:"Thrill Friends And Family With A Make It Yourself Pizza Party",body:"If there is one thing kids love more than eating pizza, it’s being able to make it themselves using all their favorite toppings.

When one consider purchasing a good cookware the first point that comes to the mind is the budget. Buying a standard cookware within one’s budget and at the same time obtaining all the pieces and features one has in mind is no simple task. If you belong to the category of people who take cooking a bit seriously you need spend some more time to look into the various aspects of a good cookware from the material from which it is made, to the number of pieces, features and the quality.\n\nThe first factor to be considered is the material in which the cookware is made. The first option is the stainless steel that is most popular, durable and convenient. It is also the most popular cookware material in North America being highly resistant against wear and tear and at the same time less expensive. It is also subject to criticism as the metals like iron, nickel, and chromium used in this alloy is said to create health hazards.\n\nThe other option for the home maker is the ceramic pottery, enamel or glass cookware. All these materials can be easily cleaned and are also heat resistant. The latest addition to this category is the plastic ware used for both cooking and storing. It has the advantage of being light weight, unbreakable and also being used in Micro wave ovens where other metals are not suitable. Cast iron cookware is normally pre coated with unsalted fat and heated to avoid rusting in the absence of porcelain coating.\n\nThe stainless cookware is to be washed in soapy water or warm ammonia with water solution. The cookware is to be rinsed and dried to obviate water spots in the cookware. Never one need use chlorine or alcohol instead only some mild cleaners. The copper cookware are to be cleaned by a commercial cleaner or a home made mixture of salt, flour citric acid, and ammonia if applied before washing would also serve the purpose. While copper cookware is highly expensive the stainless cookware with copper bottom is lesser costly. The copper bottom cookware does not spread the heat evenly and the bottom of the food gets heated faster and there are chances that the food at the bottom may get burned.\n\nOne need to buy a cookware that is less expensive, durable, and that distribute the heat evenly. Cooking pans with hot spots cooks at various speed at different spots and make cooking most unpleasant… The cookware made of cast iron, copper and aluminum may result in the food cooked to absorb the metal taste and sometimes even the metal content to get transferred to food. The fact remaining so, copper bowls are immensely useful in beating egg whites. Though aluminum is the least expensive it may cause reaction with certain type of food. If one chooses the Aluminum cookware the anodized is the best choice.\n\nOne need to remember that no cookware can be considered as the perfect and the most suitable for cooking on all occasions or for cooking of all types of foods. The ideal cookware depends on your budget, your cooking preferences and the food habits. However cookware made of stainless steel could be recommended as an ideal choice considering its price, economic life, easy cleaning, and less or no reaction with the food. No wonder it is also the most popular and sought after cookware in North America."},{title:"Barbecue Party Tips For A Truly Amazing Event",body:"Barbecue party tips can help a host put together an extraordinary event for family and friends. Eating outdoors is a favorite pastime enjoyed by everyone and planning the event can help make it more memorable and stress-free for the host. Big or small, a barbecue party requires an adequate amount of planning and preparation to ensure that everything is laid out properly.\n\nIt is advisable to plan the event around a theme in order to create a focal point for the barbecue party. This way, all aspects of the party such as the food, games and decorations can be fashioned around a central theme. Favorite themes for barbecue parties include a Hawaiian motif, nostalgic seventies get-together, or, if you are near the sea, opt for a beach bbq party!\n\nPlanning the menu is perhaps the most important part of any get-together especially for a barbecue party as most guests will be looking forward to an array of lip-smacking roasted meats dripping in bbq sauce.\n\nBarbecue on the Beach Anyone?\n\nAh, what can be better than a great barbecue on the beach? The beach is definitely one of the best locations to have a barbecue. After all, the nature of grilling and barbecuing as a cooking technique is that it’s fun, exciting and very rewarding. Similarly, the beach pretty much exudes the same atmosphere. There are a lot of fun and exciting activities to do at the beach. It’s a place where people can be themselves in their ‘bare essentials’ and the relaxation factor is definitely rewarding. Putting these two wonderful concepts together, a barbecue on the beach is pretty much a recipe for a great time!\n\nBut before you pack your stuff, gear up your grill and hit the sand for one hell of a barbecue on the beach party, bear in mind that there are various safety procedures and other rules governing beach areas so it would be best to consult authorities and secure the proper permissions before you even think about organizing a beach barbecue party.\n\nAssuming you’ve done that and you’ve already picked a nice spot, next would be preparing for your barbecue on the beach. There are various grill types that you may use for barbecuing on the beach – you have the wood or charcoal grill, gas grill or you may also use a campfire tripod. Be sure to station your grill in a stable spot, away from any flammable material and safe from people possibly bumping into it.\n\nBring your marinated meat, poultry or seafood in a cooler and take them out only when you’re ready to start barbecuing to avoid spoilage. Further, the last seasoning you would want on your barbecue on the beach is sand right? So keep them covered!\n\nAnd of course, don’t forget to pack those barbecue sauces and hot sauces to spice up your barbecue dishes. If you’re looking for something insanely different to give your barbecue that extra punch, visit www.InsaneChicken.com for their wide array of barbecue sauces, marinades and dry rubs. Treat yourself and your friends’ taste buds to their line of extremely hot products; they would definitely go well with a good beer. Now that’s what I call one unforgettable barbecue on the beach party!"},{title:"Cooking For One",body:"It is often frustrating to attempt to plan meals that are designed for one. Despite this fact, we are seeing more and more recipe books and Internet websites that are dedicated to the act of cooking for one. Divorce and the death of spouses or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that someone accustomed to cooking for more than one would suddenly need to learn how to adjust all the cooking practices utilized before into a streamlined plan of cooking that is more efficient for one person creating less waste. The mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make cooking for one a challenge rather than a trial. Use this opportunity to try new and exciting cuisines. Perhaps one of the greatest things about cooking for one is the fact that it isn’t quite as expensive as cooking for two. This means that you have a little more money in the grocery budget with which to plan and prepare your meals. One thing you may want to keep in mind however is that when cooking for one, if you prepare foods that are freezable. It may save more time (and in the end money) if you cook the full 2-4 servings that most recipes call for and freeze the leftovers in single serving portions for a later point in time. This leaves you with a freezer full of foods for those nights when the thought of cooking just seems beyond your capabilities. This also leaves you with doing the work once and enjoying the fruits of your efforts many times over. This is a great position to be in if you ask me. We are finding more and more recipes and cookbooks that are designed around the concept of cooking for one. No matter what situation placed you in the position of cooking for one, there is no reason that you shouldn’t enjoy great food that is exciting and pleasant simply because you are dining alone. There is no harm in enjoying a fabulous meal with a glass of wine and great music whether you are cooking for one or one hundred. Remember you are what you eat and if you relegate yourself to boring meals that lack excitement and spice that is what you will become. However if you decide to reach out and try new and exciting dishes with every meal you prepare when cooking for one, it will show in the way you embrace life in other areas as well. While we should not live to eat, we should also not limit ourselves to eating to live. Enjoy the foods you prepare whether the portions are large or small in size. If you do not want to invest heavily in cookbooks that relate to cooking for one, it is quite possible that your local public library will have a few from which you can find some excellent recipes tips and resources. While you are there be sure to check out their selection of exotic food cookbooks in order to spice things up a bit. You never know what treasures you may discover on the shelves or your local library. You may even find local resources on classes that center on the idea of cooking for one. If the library proves to be a bust as far as resources go, the Internet is full of recipes, tips, and hints for those who are cooking for one."},{title:"The Sweetness Of Grilling Create Scrumptious Desserts Without Heating Up The Kitchen",body:"A meal just isn’t complete without dessert. But instead of reaching for store-bought sweets or those unimaginative brownies from a box, get more mileage out of your grill by grilling your next dessert.\n\n“Years ago, even the most inventive cooks treated the idea of making desserts on a grill with skepticism, but now you can’t claim to be a master griller unless you have at least a couple desserts in your repertoire,” said Jamie Purviance, author of Weber’s Real Grilling. “The truth is out about their great taste, and then there is the dramatic effect of opening the lid and surprising your guests with sizzling sweets.”\n\nPreparing a grilled dessert can be as easy as warming fresh fruits such as halved bananas, split peaches or sliced pineapples over direct heat and serving them with a scoop of ice cream. Or you can use indirect heat to actually bake something simple such as a fruit cobbler or crisp.\n\n“In many ways, a covered grill works as an oven,” said Purviance. “The hot flames cook like a broiler that has flipped to the bottom of the oven, browning the surfaces of cut fruit, making them tender and sweeter. And, if you grill over indirect heat by turning off the middle gas burner or pushing the coals to the sides and closing the lid, you can cook a dessert in a pan over the unlit area of the grill.”\n\nPurviance has partnered with Weber-Stephen Products Co., the premier manufacturer of charcoal and gas grills, grilling accessories and other outdoor room products, to offer consumers useful and creative tips for firing up desserts on their grills. Before You Begin. If grilled fruits are on your menu, select ones that are ripe (or almost ripe) and firm. Purviance says that fruits will soften on the grill, so he recommends selecting firm produce to ensure they will hold their shape while cooking.\n\nTime and Temperature. Purviance suggests knowing how long and at what temperature to grill to produce the finest results. Peaches should be cut into halves and grilled over direct medium heat for 8-10 minutes. Bananas are best split lengthwise, with the skin left on to hold the fruit’s shape, and grilled over direct medium heat for approximately 6-8 minutes. Pineapples should be peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch slices or 1-inch wedges, then grilled for 5-10 minutes over direct medium heat.\n\nHold the Chicken. While that teriyaki chicken was delectable, its remnants left on the grill won’t taste good on grilled peaches. Purviance offers this remedy before grilling up desserts-simply brush the grates clean with a stiff wire brush.\n\nBetter with Butter. Butter makes almost anything taste better, and fruit is no exception. Purviance recommends brushing fruit lightly on all sides with melted butter and a little sugar for sweetness before grilling it. This coating will also help prevent the fruit from sticking.\n\nNever Leave Your Post. The sweet succulence of most fruits turns golden brown and delicious on the grill, but left too long in place, golden brown can turn to black and bitter. Purviance recommends watching the fruit carefully and turning occasionally. To check the color and doneness, slide a thin spatula gently under the fruit and slightly lift. Your sweet tooth will never be the same."},{title:"Southern Cooking Brings Soul To Food",body:"I was born and raised in the heart of the Deep South. From as far back as I can remember I remember long summer afternoons spent drinking iced tea and shelling peas and butterbeans on my grandmother’s porch. I have moved on from my roots and have made my way into other regions of the world. One thing, however, that has remained constant in my life is my deep and abiding love for southern cooking and cuisine. I was probably well into my teen years before I realized that tea could be served any other way than loaded with sugar and over ice. It was about that same time that I realized some folks would eat vegetables that hadn’t been soaked in batter, dredged in cornmeal, and deep fat fried. Southern cooking is not for the faint of heart though it can cause many hearts to grow faint. One thing that can be said is that you’ll never find anything else like it on earth. People in the south learned to make do with little in many instances. Some of the poorest people in America live in the southern part of the country. Of course, you will find that many of these people despite their poverty are also among the most generous. The same can be said of food. It’s the one thing that seems to be in ample supply in most southern homes and very few will turn you away with an empty stomach.\n\nPerhaps it’s the seasonings that are often used when cooking southern food. From the crab boil and gumbo file of Cajun Cuisine to the secret ingredient that almost every southern kitchen contains for their fried chicken recipes (and no one on earth can fry chicken like a born and bred southern grandma). Perhaps it’s the Sunday church dinners where everyone shares a little of what they have with others or the love that goes into preparing these meals that are shared with friends and family. Whatever the case may be, if you ever have the occasion to experience real southern cooking, do not pass it up. You might shave a day off your life, but a good southern fried chicken leg is really living and well worth the sacrifice if you ask me. Of course it would be remiss to mention southern cooking without bringing up some of the more delicious desserts that seem to be perfection for the south. I mentioned banana pudding above but there are so many more. Pralines are a perfect for those living down around New Orleans as is bread pudding. A little to the east there are grandma’s who have taken their lemon icebox pie recipes to the grave with them so coveted were these delicious deserts and the same holds true for pecan pies as well. We should never forget the flavorful Mississippi Mud cake though, and so many other wonderfully delicious treats that southern cooking has introduced to the world at large. Favorite vegetables in the heart of the south as I mentioned above included peas and butterbeans, snap beans, corn, summer squash (after all, it’s summer all year in the south), and okra (fried or boiled in many southern kitchens). Not all vegetables were deep fried though few were off limits. I remember eating my share of fried okra, fried squash, and yes, fried green tomatoes. Life was good back when calories weren’t counted and no one really worried about clogging arteries. While I wouldn’t make these a daily dish in any household, I certainly would recommend trying them out if you ever find the opportunity. Another great thing about southern cooking is the wonderful fried seafood that seems to abound. From fried fish (almost any variety works well when it’s southern fried) to fried oysters, seafood just seems to taste so much better in the south. If you are hoping to learn some of the southern cooking and cuisine you will most likely need to order your spices and have them shipped unless your grocery store has a rather extensive ‘exotic’ foods selection. You can sometimes find great southern seasonings on the International food aisles in grocery stores as well. If you want to really treat your family to an outstanding meal, you should really try southern cooking for the night."},{title:"How To Cook Turkey On Natural Gas Grills",body:"The holidays bring with them thoughts of carving and serving delicious turkey dinners to your family and friends. Tradition has its fans, but perhaps this year you’d like to try a twist to your turkey recipe. If you have a gas grill and enjoy the smoky flavor of grilled meats, why not try grilling your turkey this year? It’s not only possible, it is rather simple. And it delivers a delicious flavored bird to your table. Plus, having the turkey on the grill instead of the oven leaves you with all the room you need to prepare the rest of your dinner in less time.\n\nWhen you are ready to buy your turkey, the first thing to consider is the size of your grill. You don’t want a bird that is so enormous that it can’t fit on the grill rack. Ideally, the turkey you select should sit on the grill and the lid should close without touching the bird. If this isn’t possible, don’t worry, you can still grill your turkey. You’ll need some heavy duty aluminum foil and either a V shaped grill stand or another metal cooking instrument that you can safely use to prop open the lid of the grill.\n\nPrepare and stuff the turkey as you normally would. Place it on the grill so that it is positioned over one burner that you can turn off. Turn that burner off and the other burner or burners on. Since you can’t really “flip” a turkey, you want the turkey to cook by indirect heat, not by a direct flame underneath it.\n\nYou get the smoky flavor by using wood chips. If you haven’t used wood chips before, they’re easy to use. You soak them in water so that as they dry out from the heat of the grill, they’ll release a flavored smoke that infuses the turkey. You can purchase a tray that is designed for putting wood chips on the grill or you can make one yourself from heavy duty aluminum foil. Take the wood chips out of the water and put them into your tray. Place the tray on the grill over the lit burner.\n\nNext, close the lid fully if possible. If not possible, prop the lid up just enough to keep it from touching the turkey. Then cover the remainder of the opening with aluminum foil. If heat gets out you will probably have to cook the turkey longer. However, the foil creates enough of a barrier so the smoke is kept circulating inside the grill and flavoring the turkey.\n\nThe time required to cook the turkey will vary depending on whether or not you were able to close your grill completely. If you can, it will take less time. If you can’t, you might want to increase the heat on the other burner or burners to try to make up for the lost heat by having to prop open the grill. After a couple of hours, rotate the turkey 180 degrees to help ensure even cooking.\n\nAs with any method of cooking poultry, it’s important to make sure that the internal temperature of the meat reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Ideally you should use a meat thermometer to monitor the temperature as you cook. If you don’t have one, then you’ll have to check the readiness by poking the thigh with a fork or skewer. If the juices that run out are clear and the turkey has turned a nice golden-brown color, then you are ready to remove it from the grill. Consider glazing the turkey with a sauce you use on other meats, or possibly adding barbecue sauce to the traditional cranberry sauce as a condiment. Don’t be afraid to experiment – enjoy the new twist you’re putting on an old family tradition."},{title:"Fondue Non Alcoholic",body:"Do you want to share your love of cheese fondue with your children? Or did you just find out that one of your fondue party guests doesn’t drink alcohol? Well then it’s time to learn how to make non-alcoholic fondue. Non alcoholic fondue is great for kids and other people who for whatever their reason, have an aversion to alcohol. The white wine that provides the unique flavor to fondue can be substituted with apple cider. Apple cider will give you the great taste that you expect from fondue without the alcohol.\n\nThe story of how fondue came about goes something like this. People living through long winters in the Swiss Alps had to worry about their food supply. They ate what was on hand. At the end of the cold season, usually all that was left was hard cheeses and wine. So with some experimentation and innovation, those ingredients were combined with crunchy bread to create the first fondue dinners.\n\nSo take a lesson from the people of the Swiss Alps and use what you have on hand. Don’t worry about fondue lovers complaining that your fondue has no bite to it. Using apple cider instead of white wine is a completely acceptable solution. It taste great and will add a nice flavor to your fondue. If you use apple cider in your fondue, you will never miss the white wine.\n\nNon-Alcoholic Cheese Fondue\n\n1 cup Apple Cider (to mix with cheese)\n\n1/4 cup Apple Cider (to mix with cornstarch & mustard)\n\n2 teaspoon Lemon Juice\n\n1 tablespoon Onion (finely chopped)\n\n3 cups Cheddar Cheese (shredded)\n\n1 tablespoon Cornstarch\n\n2/3 teaspoon Mustard Powder\n\nWhite Pepper (to taste)\n\nHeat the cider, lemon juice & onions on medium low heat in your fondue pot\n\nSlowly add the cheese while stirring\n\nMix cornstarch and mustard in 1/4 cup apple cider\n\nAdd mixture to cheese\n\nAdd white pepper to taste\n\nNote: if too sweet, add more lemon juice\n\nTo Dip:\n\nCrusty Bread cut into bite-sized pieces\n\nVegetables – Mushrooms, Potatoes, Cauliflower, Broccoli, Bell Peppers, etc."},{title:"Refrigerated Treats Can Make For A Cool Event",body:"It’s always a great time to get “Back to Cool” and enjoy a picnic with family and friends.\n\nThe refrigerated dairy aisle of your local grocery store can be a great source for tasty, convenient selections for your outdoor gatherings, such as cheeses, breads, jello, dips, puddings, yogurts, juices and much more. Try ideas like these for a very tasty picnic:\n\n• Make an easy, scrumptious potato salad with convenient refrigerated potato selections. • Create and bake delicious snacks with refrigerated bread dough and shredded cheese.\n\n• Stock up on a variety of yogurt flavors and pack fresh fruit for dipping. • Try the many dips and sour cream selections and bring plenty of fresh vegetables to the picnic. • Remember the individually packed cheese slices to top grilled hamburgers or to enjoy as simple snacks.\n\n• Don’t forget the whipped toppings to make any dessert special.\n\nWhile you are planning your menu, also plan for a safe picnic. Food spoilage and cross-contamination are real concerns when eating food outdoors in warm weather. Be sure to follow these tips from the National Frozen & Refrigerated Foods Association (NFRA) to ensure your picnic is a healthy one:\n\n• Bring water for preparation and cleaning, or pack clean, wet, disposable cloths or moist towelettes and paper towels for cleaning hands, surfaces and utensils.\n\n• It’s important to keep hot food hot and cold food cold during the picnic. • Carry cold perishable foods in an insulated cooler packed with ice or frozen gel packs. Make sure raw meat and poultry are wrapped securely to prevent juices from cross-contaminating.\n\n• If bringing hot take-out food such as fried chicken, eat it within two hours of purchase or plan ahead and chill the food in the fridge before packing in an insulated cooler.\n\n• Don’t stock the cooler until immediately before leaving from home. Keep the cooler in the coolest part of the car when traveling."

Make sure to bake, braise or roast the bird at a high enough temperature to keep it safe to eat and don’t overcook it. Don’t leave your turkey in the oven to keep it warm while you get the rest of the dinner ready to serve. Take it out as soon as it’s done, let it cool outside the oven for about 20 minutes and then carve away.

In fact, people have been eating fish throughout human history. These days, many cooks yearn to add fish to their repertoire, but the whole process of cleaning and filleting fresh fish is a little scary to them. The process of cleaning and filleting fresh fish is relatively simple once the steps are understood.    To begin, you must clean your fresh fish properly in order to maintain it’s quality during the remaining steps of processing. First, use a knife or fish scaling tool to remove all of the scales. Removing the scales early on is a key to easy fish cleaning. Next, remove the fish head by cutting just behind the first set of fins. Now, insert your sharp knife into the area where you just removed the head and make a slit in the belly of the fish. You will want to slit the fish belly all the way down to the vent next to the tail. This should open up the cavity of the fish and you can pull or cut away any viscera or organs from inside the fish. The next step is to cut away any additional fins that the fish may have. Do this by cutting into the fish in a circular motion around the fins and remove them. Finally, rinse the fish body and cavity under cold, running water. Now that the fish has been properly cleaned, you can move on to filleting.   Begin the fish filleting process by laying the fish on one side and inserting your knife into the fish body almost to the backbone. Guide your knife along the backbone, exposing the fillet as you cut. You will have to lift and separate the flesh from the bone as you cut. Next, repeat this process for the other side. Once you have created the two fish fillets, place them skin side down and cut through the flesh next to the tail. Do not cut through the skin next to the tail, as you will hold onto this skin as you separate the skin from the flesh. Insert your fillet knife between the flesh and the skin and use a back and forth motion to separate the two. Rinse the fillets with cold water and be sure to dry them before storing or using.   These simple and easy steps are all that it takes to make the most out of fresh fish. With these steps in mind you can prepare fresh fish for any meal."},{title:"Fun Grill Sizzle",body:"Beach party, picnic or just a simple get-together at home will never feel complete unless you mount gas grills on one side and start grilling your favorite fish or meat. Just the aroma of smoked fish can confer you a festive mood. In fact, it can afterwards drag you to a luscious and appetizing meal. The festive mood will be contagious and the fun will linger.\n\nIsn’t it amazing how a simple grilling session on your front yard can trigger delightful bond and overwhelming fun? People, by nature, longs for fun and excitement. Nobody wants to sulk in one corner all the time. He sure wants to take a break and enjoy. Every person deserves to be happy. Moreover, if you are throwing a bashing small shindig, pool party or a simple gathering, let your guests enjoy to the fullest by preparing them their favorite entertainment and foods.\n\nFor sure, just every one likes grilled foods. In order to enjoy the gathering be sure to have gas grills around. Gas grills have metal box. At the bottom of the box, there are tube-shaped liquid propane burners which are responsible in providing the grills with fuel. Traditionally, propane or natural gas fuel the gas grills. With them, grilling is made faster and easier. The gas grills’ burners are topped by warming the exterior of the metal bars, ceramics and lava rocks.\n\nModern day gas grills are more beneficial. If you want fast pre-heating, gas grills will help you do it pretty fast. Fast in the sense that it can preheat in a matter of 10 to 15 minutes. Second benefit is its longevity compared to charcoal. One 20-pound tank can last up to 14 hours. You will no longer fret about running short of charcoal. Propane tank is more reliable, that is.\n\nIf you are worrying about the mess of grilling, worry no more. Since, gas grills do not use fire starters or charcoal, mess will be out of the situation.\n\nGrass grills use multiple burners. They are especially designed to give superior heat control to secure easy grilling.\n\nIf you are contemplating of purchasing gas grills, here are the considerations that you have to take note of:\n\n1. Consider having stainless steel, cast aluminum or porcelain-coated steel for a solid gas grill construction. 2. It is vital to have a built-in thermometer to check the grill temperature.\n\n3. Lava rock system is also good in collecting grease that can result to flare-ups. Try to look for them in the gas grill that you are to purchase.\n\n4. For easy and safe gas grill lighting, be sure to have a push-button ignition. 5. To monitor fuel levels your gas grill must have gas gauge.\n\n6. If you can have three burners that can work separately, the better. This will give you flexibility when it comes to controlling heat.\n\n7. For easy cleaning, the best gas grill material will be stainless steel or porcelain.\n\nAside from the aforementioned features, you can also incorporate rotisserie or smoker box, side burners, additional outer shelving or work space and removable secondary grill racks.\n\nIn order to have a long-lasting gas grill, maintenance is a must. Regularly check on grease catch pan so as not to create flare-ups. Check for leaks, cracks and holes. Finally, be sure to detach tanks from gas grills and keep them out-of-doors."},{title:"Deep Fried Turkey Practice",body:"While your neighbors are putting up their Halloween decorations and scouring supermarkets for bargain candy, it’s the perfect time for you to deep fry a turkey.

For each cup of finished gravy you will need one tablespoon of fat, one tablespoon of flour and 1 cup of broth. Start by making up some rich turkey broth. You can use the turkey neck, heart, gizzard or other parts usually found packed inside the turkey cavity. Add some minced onion, diced celery and 1/2 teaspoon salt in enough water to cover, simmer until vegetables are tender. Dice the turkey liver, add to the broth and simmer for about 15 minutes.\n\nYou can use the turkey bones if you like. The turkey bones yield much more broth, just add more onions and celery to the pan. You will have to carve the turkey ahead of time, which means no whole roasted turkey sitting on the dinner table waiting to be carved by the host or hostess.   \n\nMake sure you use the drippings from the roasting pan, as grandpa always said “that’s the goodies”, just after you’ve removed the cooked turkey and roasting rack from the roasting pan. Strain poultry drippings through a sieve into a 4-cup glass measuring cup. Add 3 tablespoons of corn oil to the bottom of the roasting pan. Stir around to get out the brown bits that have baked on. Add to your turkey drippings. “Wash” the roasting pan out with the turkey broth if it’s made or add water your going to use in the broth if you haven’t made it yet.  The trick is to know how many cups of broth you have and if you have enough fat. Remember you will need one tablespoon of fat, one tablespoon of flour and 1 cup of broth for each cup of finished gravy.\n\nIf you are light on broth you can add some canned chicken broth. If you are light on fat you can add a small amount of corn oil. You can save the rest of your broth for storing and reheating the turkey. Here are a few more tips to making great tasting gravy: First take the measured fat and combine with the proper amount of measured flour in a medium saucepan. Make sure you have covered all the flour with fat and blended it well. Place on burner. Slowly bring the flour and fat mixture to a simmer until it begins to smell slightly salty. It will be bubbly; the color will be a light brown.\n\nNext remove pan from burner; whisk in all the measured liquids. \n\nFinally return the pan to the burner, again, slowly bring this to a simmer. Remember you already cooked the flour in the fat so all you need to do now is stir this until it thickens up to your liking. You can let it stay sort of thin or let it cook out until it is thicker than your Mashed potatoes. The choice is yours."},{title:"Thrill Friends And Family With A Make It Yourself Pizza Party",body:"If there is one thing kids love more than eating pizza, it’s being able to make it themselves using all their favorite toppings.

Some tips for making smarter food choices include:\n\n* Go whole grain. Consume three or more 1-ounce servings of whole-grain products per day, along with three servings of enriched grains.\n\n* Eat calcium-rich foods. Consume two cups per day of fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products.\n\n* Find balance between physical activity and food you eat. Make sure you aren’t taking in more calories than you’re using or burning.\n\n* Limit intake of saturated and trans fats. Trans fats have been linked to increased risk of heart disease. Look for low or no trans fats on the label.\n\n* Get active. Engaging in regular physical activity and reducing sedentary activities can promote good health, psychological well-being and a healthy body weight.\n\n* Size does matter.

Planning breakfast for dinner is a good way to serve up simple, satisfying evening meals without spending a lot of time in the kitchen.\n\nA strata is one easy-to-prepare dish that can go from breakfast to dinner with ease. The word strata means layers and the layers of Tomato Strata Florentine are simply cubed bread, torn spinach and seasoned chopped tomatoes. An egg-milk custard poured over the top binds the bright-colored layers together and causes the bread to puff up during baking.\n\nFor single diners or families whose members eat at separate times, bake the ingredients in individual custard cups which you can refrigerate and reheat in the microwave. For a family meal, use a baking pan. Either way, you can make the strata the night before you want to serve it. Simply leave a note for the first one home to pop it into the oven.\n\nThis budget-wise combination is nutrient dense. Along with cheese and milk, the eggs provide about 1/3 of your daily protein needs, while the bread and tomato supply carbohydrates. Together, the ingredients add up to an impressive array of needed vitamins and minerals, at less than 200 calories and only 8 grams of fat per serving. Other breakfast dishes make good dinners, too.

When one consider purchasing a good cookware the first point that comes to the mind is the budget. Buying a standard cookware within one’s budget and at the same time obtaining all the pieces and features one has in mind is no simple task. If you belong to the category of people who take cooking a bit seriously you need spend some more time to look into the various aspects of a good cookware from the material from which it is made, to the number of pieces, features and the quality.\n\nThe first factor to be considered is the material in which the cookware is made. The first option is the stainless steel that is most popular, durable and convenient. It is also the most popular cookware material in North America being highly resistant against wear and tear and at the same time less expensive. It is also subject to criticism as the metals like iron, nickel, and chromium used in this alloy is said to create health hazards.\n\nThe other option for the home maker is the ceramic pottery, enamel or glass cookware. All these materials can be easily cleaned and are also heat resistant. The latest addition to this category is the plastic ware used for both cooking and storing. It has the advantage of being light weight, unbreakable and also being used in Micro wave ovens where other metals are not suitable. Cast iron cookware is normally pre coated with unsalted fat and heated to avoid rusting in the absence of porcelain coating.\n\nThe stainless cookware is to be washed in soapy water or warm ammonia with water solution. The cookware is to be rinsed and dried to obviate water spots in the cookware. Never one need use chlorine or alcohol instead only some mild cleaners. The copper cookware are to be cleaned by a commercial cleaner or a home made mixture of salt, flour citric acid, and ammonia if applied before washing would also serve the purpose. While copper cookware is highly expensive the stainless cookware with copper bottom is lesser costly. The copper bottom cookware does not spread the heat evenly and the bottom of the food gets heated faster and there are chances that the food at the bottom may get burned.\n\nOne need to buy a cookware that is less expensive, durable, and that distribute the heat evenly. Cooking pans with hot spots cooks at various speed at different spots and make cooking most unpleasant… The cookware made of cast iron, copper and aluminum may result in the food cooked to absorb the metal taste and sometimes even the metal content to get transferred to food. The fact remaining so, copper bowls are immensely useful in beating egg whites. Though aluminum is the least expensive it may cause reaction with certain type of food. If one chooses the Aluminum cookware the anodized is the best choice.\n\nOne need to remember that no cookware can be considered as the perfect and the most suitable for cooking on all occasions or for cooking of all types of foods. The ideal cookware depends on your budget, your cooking preferences and the food habits. However cookware made of stainless steel could be recommended as an ideal choice considering its price, economic life, easy cleaning, and less or no reaction with the food. No wonder it is also the most popular and sought after cookware in North America."},{title:"Barbequed Ribs Kansas City Style",body:"Kansas City ribs are serious business when it comes to BBQ. True to tradition, barbeque in Kansas City is dry rub-spiced, smoked with hickory and coated with a KC style sauce. For Kansas City sauce means a thick, rich and tangy tomato based sauce with molasses and sometimes a hint of vinegar. The meat is seared, slow cooked and mop basted with sauce until the meat is tender and a nice crust has formed on the outside. Roll up your sleeves and get ready for sauce that you enjoy getting under your fingernails.\n\nKansas City’s first recorded barbequer was Henry Perry back in 1908. Perry become very well known for his succulent ribs and would serve them to customer who would come from miles away. Perry converted an old trolley barn into a restaurant and would serve is ribs on newspaper for 25 cents a slab. “Old Man Perry’s” restaurant was located at 19th & Highland and was later sold to George Gates and Charlie Bryant. It become known as Arthur Bryant’s and is still today regarded as one of America’s greatest rib joints. Today Kansas City boast over 90 rib restaurants.\n\nAs with any rib, first start by removing the membrane on the back of the rib. This can prove to be difficult with wet finger. Dry hands and a paper towel work well for this. The paper towel will allow you to get a better grip on the membrane. Evenly coat the ribs with the dry rub, wrap with plastic wrap and then foil. Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours but overnight is best. 30 minutes before you are ready to cook the ribs, remove them from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature. Continually mop the ribs with sauce until finished cooking.

We boil salted meats with vegetables and call it – well, a boiled dinner. Our clam chowder is white, our baked beans have bacon and molasses in them, and no one in the world has ever invented a food that was improved by the addition of curry. By the time I was eighteen, I could boil a lobster, steam clams and grill a pork chop to perfection. Then I moved to Virginia, picked up a roommate from North Carolina – and discovered a whole new world of down home country cooking goodness.\n\nTo an All-American Italian girl from Boston, the menus in restaurants were in a foreign language. Chicken-fried steak, grits, corn pone pudding, strawberry rhubarb pie – sweet potato pie?? In my mind, chicken and steak were two different meats, grits is what’s on sandpaper, corn is a vegetable – and what in the world is sweet potato doing in a crust? But I became a fervent convert to Southern cooking the first time my roommate made up a pan of the sweetest, tastiest, most perfectly melt-in-your-mouth delicious Southern baking powder biscuits and topped them with sausage gravy. From that day on, I was Sue’s disciple, standing at her elbow as she diced scallions to make up a mess of pinto beans, stirred the milk into a pan of drippings for milk gravy and rolled thin steak strips in chicken batter to make chicken-fried steak.\n\nDown home southern cooking is no different than New England plain cooking – at least at its most basic level. Like any other regional style of cooking, it makes use of the ingredients that are plentiful and cheap. In New England we gussy up our dried beans with brown sugar and molasses, and serve them with thick, sweet heavy brown bread dotted with raisins – perfect fare for cold winter nights. In North Carolina, they simmer for hours with salt pork and onions and served with scallions for scooping and a side of flaky biscuits cut out of dough with a juice glass. Salty, spicy and flaky-good all at once, it’s a down home meal that makes my mouth water just to remember.\n\nSome dishes just don’t translate, though. There is no New England substitute for a Southern barbecue sandwich – shredded pork simmered with spices for hours and ladled over buns in a ‘sandwich’ that really requires a fork. The ubiquitous ‘sloppy joe’ just doesn’t cut it. It lacks the spicy-sweet tang and buttery texture of real slow-simmered pork barbecue. Nor is there anything that compares with chicken fried steak – a dish that can’t be described in words without selling it short. If you’ve had it, you KNOW how good it is. If you haven’t, the idea of dredging and dipping strips of beef and frying it like chicken just doesn’t do it justice.\n\nMy New England Italian roots show wherever I go. Lasagna will always be a favorite meal, and New England boiled dinners still make my mouth water. But I know, deep in my soul, that when I go to Heaven, the diners will serve flaky Southern biscuits with sausage gravy and chicken fried steak. Some temptations even the angels can’t resist."

This means that to enjoy authentic gourmet food you must prepare your food immediately after purchasing the fresh ingredients that will comprise your meals. Not only do you want to purchase the freshest ingredients when cooking gourmet meals but you also want to insure that you are purchasing ingredients of superior quality.\n\nThose who excel at gourmet cooking and food preparation have many options available to them. From catering to opening up their own restaurant these talented individuals who are entrepreneurial in spirit often do quite well in the world of business if their talent is sufficient. When it comes to cooking gourmet food the two rules mentioned above are the only hard and fast rules. Everything else is purely a matter of adventure and taste. Now this doesn’t mean that any and everyone can become a gourmet cook simply by going out and purchasing the finest and freshest of ingredients and throwing them into a pot. There is some degree of art involved when it comes to gourmet cooking and a large degree of skill that is necessary in order to achieve these culinary masterpieces. You should also understand and be prepared to discover that fresh ingredients are not always available so there are times when compromises must be made when cooking gourmet meals. For this reason you capitalize on what is in season and plan your meals accordingly whenever possible. One important quality when it comes to cooking gourmet food is the layering of flavors. You should be able to taste the meat or seafood as well as the vegetables, herbs, and spices that comprise your skillfully prepared meal. You should not however rely on taste or aroma alone when cooking gourmet foods. As I mentioned above gourmet cooking is a large degree skill but there is some degree of art involved. For this reason, presentation is a key component of the gourmet dining experience. Through a few freshly chopped herbs on the plate before placing the food or top the food with appealing and aromatic herbs that will compliment the flavor of the meal you have prepared. Present the fruits and vegetable sides in a visually appealing fashion rather than simply tossing them onto a plate. With proper presentation even foods that were simple to prepare can take on the flavor of a gourmet feast. This is something you should keep in mind whether your cooking plans for the evening involve the gourmet or the every day. The thing about gourmet cooking is that it is to some degree more art than science. This means that there is always room to improve your skills and stretch your limits as a cook. There will always be the next great challenge or the ‘what if’ when it comes to flavor combinations. In fact, some of the greatest foods began with someone asking, “What would happen if I added this?” Always ask what if and always seek to improve your skills. The good news if this is an avenue you wish to pursue is that there are often gourmet cooking classes offered at gourmet food shops in your area. Some colleges or local community programs will also offer these sorts of classes for a few if you are interested. This means that there are almost always opportunities to broaden your experiences with gourmet cooking and expand your horizons.\n\nWhether this is your first time considering gourmet cooking or you are an old pro, keep in mind that skills can be learned over time with the proper motivation and an open and honest desire to learn. If you want to learn more about gourmet cooking there is really nothing to stop you from doing so other than yourself. The Internet, your local library, and many bookstores across the country have countless volumes of information that can help you get started on your journey to gourmet cooking bliss."},{title:"Cooking Cajun Food",body:"Cooking in the heart of Cajun country is an art form. There really is very little science to this particular form of cooking that includes a lot more than mere lagniappe from the pantry or the spice cabinet. Cajun cooking is something that has often been imitated around the country and around the world but can very rarely be accurately duplicated.\n\nOne of the fascinating things about Cajun cooking is the fact that there are very few exact recipes. Most, if not all authentic Cajun cooking is done to taste rather than measurements. Even more amazing is that from day to day one person can make the same dish over and over and it is quite likely to taste a little bit different each and every time it is made. The major reason for this is that in addition to being an art form in and of itself, Cajun food is often made even more delicious or mysterious simply by the mood of the one doing the cooking.\n\nI’m sure that many of you have watched as Emeril Lagasse makes some special concoction and exclaims “Bam!” there is a good bit of that when it comes to Cajun cooking. Something that goes far beyond the ingredients in the recipe and somewhere into the heart and the soul of the cook in question. There is a reason that many southern cooked dishes are referred to as soul food and you should not for one second forget that New Orleans is in the heart of the Deep South. The most difficult thing, perhaps when it comes to preparing good Cajun dishes outside of the New Orleans region is finding the right ingredients. It is nearly impossible to find the fresh seasonings and spices that are essential to most Cajun cuisine outside the heart of the old south. Not only that, but fresh crawfish and andouille sausage are a little difficult to come by during the heart of a Michigan winter.\n\nIf you are determined to learn to make Cajun food of your own, you must first find the ingredients. Specialty food shops or those that will special order might be your best bet. There are some grocers that will carry a limited stock of Cajun seasonings on their international food aisles. Keep in mind that these sources are extremely limited. Once you have the ingredients, it’s time to let a little jazz blare from your speakers in order to set the mood. Most of the best Cajun dishes require a substantial amount of time for simmering and this should be considered. Cajun food is not to be rushed-much like the citizens of the Big Easy. The food will be ready in time and as the one cooking the food you must learn to accept that about Cajun food. It has a way of letting you know when it is ready that is almost mythical until you’ve experienced it for yourself. Cooking Cajun food will try your patience, try your talents, and in some cases zap your energy, as it tends to be an emotional process for many. On the other end however, Cajun food is some of the richest and most delicious food on the planet. Mastering the ability to cook this wonderful food will make you a slave to its flavor for many years to come."},{title:"Delivering Kisses And Miracles",body:"There are many ways chocolate makes people happy and one of the worthiest is a tour that has been described as the “chocolate lover’s dream.”\n\nFor 10 years, the Hershey’s Kissmobile Cruisers have crisscrossed the country to raise awareness of and donations for the 170 nonprofit Children’s Miracle Network hospitals.\n\nThe Kissmobile Cruisers visit more than 70 North American cities and drive more than 70,000 miles each year.

This is a wrong idea. Personal chefs are now helping couples and families to present fabulous home cooked dinners to their guests. And it’s not as expensive as you think! The reasons of hiring a personal chef: A personal chef will bring the food, create a nutritious and balanced meal, figure out the servings needed (so you don’t need to deal with leftovers) and most of all give you the freedom to focus on other aspects of entertaining while still providing the best food for your guests. Are you hosting a business lunch? An intimate wedding reception? Or even an intimate dinner for two that just has to be the best? A personal chef can handle any order. You can usually choose from a selection of courses they provide or arrange for a customized menu. The cost: Prices will vary but you can expect a weeks worth of meals (containers, food and cooking included) to be about $350 for a family of 4 (20 meals of entrees and side dishes) or $175 for a couple (10 meals of entrees and side dishes). Some services will prepare all the meals at once while others will deliver or prepare the meal in your home throughout the week. Place to hire a personal chef: Finding a chef is easy by using the USPCA (United States Personal Chef Association) or the CPCA (Canadian Personal Chef Alliance). Here you will find information on personal chefs as well as a directory of members in your area. Don’t view a personal chef as a catering service. They are more professional. For busy professionals who are looking for quality meals and more time with their family, a personal chef will prepare several entrees and side dishes, store them and clean the kitchen. For the rest of the week all you have to do is take them out of the fridge or freezer and reheat to enjoy gourmet meals all week. For families who turn to fast foods and restaurants the cost may actually be less than what they are currently paying. Some personal chefs also can be booked for private or group cooking lessons. Invite a group of your friends to learn the art of creating delectable pasties or sumptuous seafood from an expert! If you want to have a wonderful time at home, relax all day, no need to wake up in the morning to do a cookery, a personal chef is the best solution for you."},{title:"Messes Make Memories",body:"Want some good family fun?

It should be pointed out that in the United States the proportion of the population under 40 that can be clinically defined as obese now exceeds 25%. Many children are obese and are developing type 2 diabetes at an alarming epidemic rate. The dramatic rise in obesity in the US has lead to an equally alarming increase in the percentage of the population who suffer from the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, one of which involves insulin resistance characteristic in type 2 diabetes. It should be pointed out that obesity alone does not always lead to insulin resistance as some individuals who are obese do not experience insulin resistance and conversely, some individuals who manifest insulin resistance are not obese.\n\nIs diabetes serious?\n\nYes. Diabetes is a life-long condition. High blood glucose levels over a long period of time can cause blindness, heart disease, kidney problems, amputations, nerve damage, and erectile dysfunction. Good diabetes care and management can delay or prevent the onset of these complications.\n\nThe good news\n\nYou can live a long and healthy life by keeping your blood glucose levels in your target range. You can do this by:\n\n1. Eating healthy meals\n\n2. Being physically active regularly\n\n3. Taking diabetes medication, including insulin\n\nThings you should know about insulin\n\nWhen insulin was first discovered and made available for people with diabetes, there was only one kind of short-acting insulin. This required several injections a day. As time went on, new insulins were developed that lasted longer, requiring fewer injections, but requiring strict attention to timing of meals.\n\nThis gives more flexibility in the number and timing of injections, making it easier to maintain target blood glucose levels, based on your lifestyle. One to four injections a day may be suggested to you for optimal control of your blood glucose.\n\nAre there any precautions before changing over to insulin?\n\nBefore considering a move to insulin it is worth examining all the option with regard to combination therapy. Diet should be optimised and the benefit of exercise discussed. It is important to be aware of the possibility of weight gain and of the need to maintain weight ‘neutral’ especially if already obese."},{title:"What S Under Your Grill",body:"Whether you barbecue on a popularly priced grill or a top-of-the-line, stainless, multi-burner behemoth, there are some things that don’t change. Sparks, spills, grease and flare-ups are inevitable when cooking and eating in your backyard, whether it involves feeding the family or entertaining a crowd. Outdoor living can cause serious damage to a patio, porch or deck in which you’ve made a substantial financial investment and perhaps devoted many hours of labor. As outdoor rooms become increasingly popular, many decks and patios are getting bigger and more deluxe, which translates to more costly.\n\nYou can, however, invest a few dollars in a grill pad now to avoid spending thousands of dollars later replacing or repairing the damaged outdoor living surface. U.S. homeowners currently spend over $230 billion annually on remodeling and renovation, and a full third of that staggering amount is for outdoor amenities, with decks and patios a priority. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reports that more than half the 1.8 million new homes built have decks, patios or porches.\n\nThe “Original” Grill Pad is a lightweight, flexible, fiber-cement deck protector that is so durable it will outlast most grills. It is easily cleaned with a garden hose and “breathes” to minimize water buildup that can cause stains and even mildew on the expensive surface beneath it. You’ll want one under each of your outdoor heating appliances including grills, smokers, turkey fryers, chimeneas or firepits.\n\nThe pads are available in five designer colors to match any outdoor d      "},{title:"The Importance Of Food Elements",body:"The purposes of food are to promote growth, to supply force and heat, and to furnish material to repair the waste which is constantly taking place in the body. Every breath, every thought, every motion, wears out some portion of the delicate and wonderful house in which we live. Various vital processes remove these worn and useless particles; and to keep the body in health, their loss must be made good by constantly renewed supplies of material properly adapted to replenish the worn and impaired tissues. This renovating material must be supplied through the medium of food and drink, and the best food is that by which the desired end may be most readily and perfectly attained. The great diversity in character of the several tissues of the body, makes it necessary that food should contain a variety of elements, in order that each part may be properly nourished and replenished. The Food Elements.\n\nThe various elements found in food are the following: Starch, sugar, fats, albumen, mineral substances, indigestible substances. The digestible food elements are often grouped, according to their chemical composition, into three classes; vis., carbonaceous, nitrogenous, and inorganic. The carbonaceous class includes starch, sugar, and fats; the nitrogenous, all albuminous elements; and the inorganic comprises the mineral elements. Starch is only found in vegetable foods; all grains, most vegetables, and some fruits, contain starch in abundance. Several kinds of sugar are made in nature’s laboratory; cane, grape, fruit, and milk sugar. The first is obtained from the sugar-cane, the sap of maple trees, and from the beet root. Grape and fruit sugars are found in most fruits and in honey. Milk sugar is one of the constituents of milk. Glucose, an artificial sugar resembling grape sugar, is now largely manufactured by subjecting the starch of corn or potatoes to a chemical process; but it lacks the sweetness of natural sugars, and is by no means a proper substitute for them. Albumen is found in its purest, uncombined state in the white of an egg, which is almost wholly composed of albumen. It exists, combined with other food elements, in many other foods, both animal and vegetable. It is found abundant in oatmeal, and to some extent in the other grains, and in the juices of vegetables. All natural foods contain elements which in many respects resemble albumen, and are so closely allied to it that for convenience they are usually classified under the general name of “albumen.” The chief of these is gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley. Casein, found in peas, beans, and milk, and the fibrin of flesh, are elements of this class. Fats are found in both animal and vegetable foods. Of animal fats, butter and suet are common examples. In vegetable form, fat is abundant in nuts, peas, beans, in various of the grains, and in a few fruits, as the olive. As furnished by nature in nuts, legumes, grains, fruits, and milk, this element is always found in a state of fine subdivision, which condition is the one best adapted to its digestion. As most commonly used, in the form of free fats, as butter, lard, etc., it is not only difficult of digestion itself, but often interferes with the digestion of the other food elements which are mixed with it. It was doubtless never intended that fats should be so modified from their natural condition and separated from other food elements as to be used as a separate article of food. The same may be said of the other carbonaceous elements, sugar and starch, neither of which, when used alone, is capable of sustaining life, although when combined in a proper and natural manner with other food elements, they perform a most important part in the nutrition of the body. Most foods contain a percentage of the mineral elements. Grains and milk furnish these elements in abundance. The cellulose, or woody tissue, of vegetables, and the bran of wheat, are examples of indigestible elements, which although they cannot be converted into blood in tissue, serve an important purpose by giving bulk to the food. With the exception of gluten, none of the food elements, when used alone, are capable of supporting life. A true food substance contains some of all the food elements, the amount of each varying in different foods. Uses of The Food Elements.\n\nConcerning the purpose which these different elements serve, it has been demonstrated by the experiments of eminent physiologists that the carbonaceous elements, which in general comprise the greater bulk of the food, serve three purposes in the body; 1. They furnish material for the production of heat; 2. They are a source of force when taken in connection with other food elements; 3. They replenish the fatty tissues of the body. Of the carbonaceous elements, starch, sugar, and fats, fats produce the greatest amount of heat in proportion to quantity; that is, more heat is developed from a pound of fat than from an equal weight of sugar or starch; but this apparent advantage is more than counterbalanced by the fact that fats are much more difficult of digestion than are the other carbonaceous elements, and if relied upon to furnish adequate material for bodily heat, would be productive of much mischief in overtaxing and producing disease of the digestive organs. The fact that nature has made a much more ample provision of starch and sugars than of fats in man’s natural diet, would seem to indicate that they were intended to be the chief source of carbonaceous food; nevertheless, fats, when taken in such proportion as nature supplies them, are necessary and important food elements. The nitrogenous food elements especially nourish the brain, nerves, muscles, and all the more highly vitalized and active tissues of the body, and also serve as a stimulus to tissue change. Hence it may be said that a food deficient in these elements is a particularly poor food. The inorganic elements, chief of which are the phosphates, in the carbonates of potash, soda, and lime, aid in furnishing the requisite building material for bones and nerves. Proper Combinations of Foods.\n\nWhile it is important that our food should contain some of all the various food elements, experiments upon both animals and human beings show it is necessary that these elements, especially the nitrogenous and carbonaceous, be used in certain definite proportions, as the system is only able to appropriate a certain amount of each; and all excess, especially of nitrogenous elements, is not only useless, but even injurious, since to rid the system of the surplus imposes an additional task upon the digestive and excretory organs. The relative proportion of these elements necessary to constitute a food which perfectly meets the requirements of the system, is six of carbonaceous to one of nitrogenous. Scientists have devoted much careful study and experimentation to the determination of the quantities of each of the food elements required for the daily nourishment of individuals under the varying conditions of life, and it has come to be commonly accepted that of the nitrogenous material which should constitute one sixth of the nutrients taken, about three ounces is all that can be made use of in twenty-four hours, by a healthy adult of average weight, doing a moderate amount of work. Many articles of food are, however, deficient in one or the other of these elements, and need to be supplemented by other articles containing the deficient element in superabundance, since to employ a dietary in which any one of the nutritive elements is lacking, although in bulk it may be all the digestive organs can manage, is really starvation, and will in time occasion serious results. It is thus apparent that much care should be exercised in the selection and combination of food materials. Such knowledge is of first importance in the education of cooks and housekeepers, since to them falls the selection of the food for the daily needs of the household; and they should not only understand what foods are best suited to supply these needs, but how to combine them in accordance with physiological laws."},{title:"Secret To Cooking Vegetables",body:"Vegetables are essential to the human diet. We get a great deal of our daily vitamin content from vegetables. We need to make sure that how we cook them does not drain vitamin contents and benefits of consumption.\n\nCooking vegetables can be tricky. Over cooking can make vegetables bland and soggy. My belief is that vegetables should not be boiled. Boling not only rob us of vitamin content, it is the main culprit in turning vegetables to a lifeless, tasteless form.\n\nIf we cannot boil, how do we proceed?\n\nFirst option, steaming vegetables is always a good choice. This will leave vegetables full of life. They will be crisp and colorful. It will also not deplete the vegetables of their vitamin content.\n\nBy rule of thumb, vegetables will only need a few minutes in the steam.\n\nFor those who do not have official vegetable steamers, an easy steamer can be fashioned out a of pot, a metal colander, and a pot lid. Place a small amount of water in the bottom of a given pot. Fit the metal colander into the pot. Start to boil the water. You will begin the see the steam rise. Place your vegetables into the metal colander and place the pot lid over the metal colander and pot. This collection of kitchen items will allow you to steam vegetables as good as any fancy store bought steamer.\n\nAnother good option is to cook your vegetables in a wok. The secret to the wok is that it cooks quickly at a very high temperature. Vegetables retain their flavors, textures, and colors with small amount of nutrient loss.\n\nMy favorite wok recipe for vegetables is to cook broccoli, carrots, bok choy, and snow peas in a very light garlic sauce. The vegetables remain crisp and the garlic adds just the right amount of flavoring. This combination can be served with any cut of meat.\n\nI hope you will see that secret to cooking vegetables is not to over cook. Vegetables need to remain crisp, full of color. As you learn different tricks to bringing your vegetables to life, these will become the most requested dishes on your dinner table."},{title:"Is It Frosting Or Is It Icing",body:"Home cooks most generally use the term frosting and icing interchangeably. This can cause confusion.\n\nIn order to reduce that confusion I like to make a distinction between the two on my website.\n\nFrosting\n\nFrosting is a fluffy, thick concoction that will hold its shape. You can pipe decorations with it like you see on cakes.\n\nEven though it holds a shape it stays soft and keeps its creamy texture.\n\nThere are as many variations of frosting recipes, as there are cookie recipes. One of the most popular is butter cream.\n\nEven within the butter cream category there is no one definitive recipe.\n\nIt seems that every country that can get its hands on butter has its opinion of what butter cream frosting should be. Some are made with eggs and butter. Some varieties you have to cook sugar to a softball stage.\n\nThere are others that use shortening or a combination of shortening and butter. Still others don’t use butter or shortening at all but another substance such as peanut butter.\n\nA simple butter cream is just butter, sugar, flavoring and a liquid beaten and beaten until it is light and fluffy. It can be flavored with most any flavoring and colored any color during the beating stage.\n\nAfter beating, other ingredients such as dried fruit, nuts or melted chocolate can be folded in.\n\nIcing\n\nIcing is normally much thinner than frosting and in this state will not hold shapes. Because it’s more liquid it flows easily and thins out filling in nooks and crannies.\n\nWhat differentiates icing from frosting is that as icing dries it becomes smooth and will harden when completely dry. This makes it perfect glue for cookie construction projects, such as a gingerbread house.\n\nFor the cookie decorator that’s not handy with a piping bag icing is the ideal cookie decorating medium.\n\nJust like frosting there are hundreds and hundreds of icing recipes and recipe variations. An icing recipe can be as simple as powdered sugar mixed with a liquid to more complicated meringue varieties.\n\nOne of the better known meringue variations is Royal Icing. Depending on the amount of liquid used Royal Icing can be piped and will hold shapes like frosting but it will harden as it dries.\n\nSo is it icing? Or is it frosting?\n\nIn my humble opinion it boils down to one thing. If it stays soft (within reason) it’s frosting. If, when it dries, it hardens then it’s icing."

This is a disorder in which the damage occurs in the colon as a result of inflammation of the tissue. However, chrones is a prevalent disorder that is often misdiagnosed as ulcerative colitis, as they share many of the same symptoms.\n\nBasically chrones and ulcerative colitis are very similar disorders. They are both forms of IBD in which the body’s immune system overreacts and causes tissue to swell excessively. Ulcerative colitis, though, is only found in the colon. On the other hand, chrones can literally be anywhere in the digestive tract. It is, however, most often found at the beginning of the large intestine and the end of the small intestine.\n\nWith chrones, when the wall of the bowel becomes swollen and inflamed, it is easily damaged by waste as it travels through the system. This damage sometimes results in scare tissue, which steadily narrows the passages even more than the original inflammation. The primary problem with chrones is this domino reaction – inflammation occurs, damage is done, scare tissue is formed, more damage is done, more scare tissue is formed, so on and so forth. The ending result is often blocked passages in which no waste can pass. When a blockage occurs, the threat of a rupture is a very serious concern for chrones sufferers. For this reason, if blockages are not resolved quickly, surgery is often used to remove the damaged area and the blockage.\n\nOn the other hand, there is still quite a threat even before any scar tissue forms. When damage is done to the bowel wall, ulcers and/or fistulas may form. An ulcer is a type of sore on the tissue which can easily become infected. On the other hand, a fistula is a severe ulcer that tunnels into surrounding tissue, such as the vagina or bladder. If an infection occurs, it could be deadly if not treated properly. Meanwhile, feces may pass through the fistulas which only compound the problem.\n\nPatients with chrones are not necessarily sick all the time. They tend to have bouts of inflammation followed by calm times in which their system works fine, or at least as well as a damaged system can. However, this roller coaster often makes it difficult for someone with chrones to function and deal with daily life, as interruptions are always a possibility."},{title:"The Best Treatment For Acne Vulgaris Tca Skin Peels Used By Plastic Surgeons Everywhere",body:"Acne vulgaris (acne) is a condition, popular with teens and young adults, that is characterized by red, inflamed bumps and patches. These bumps and patches are formed by overactive sebacious glands (usually due to hormonal imbalances), high skin pH, oil, and basteria that thrive in these conditions. This acne can be worsened by summer heat, improper cleaning, itching and picking at the bumps (they are not pimples and will only get worse when picked at), pH imbalance, bad nutrition, etc…\n\nBy changing our habits we can improve this condition. Using mild soaps and cleansers will prove less irritating. Eating a well balanced diet will average out the condition and slowly improve it. And we all know not to pick at acne postules and bumps, but to stop it and possibly cure it we have to get to the source deep in the skin.\n\nSurface treatments like benzoyl peroxide creams and solutions are at best minimally effective and can further irritate the condition. We need to get several layers down to the source, the bacteria, inflamation, and the sebacious glands where acne forms.\n\nPlastic surgeons know that glycolic and salicylic peels are better than hydrogen peroxide treatments, but they will not reach the source. This is where plastic surceons and doctors use TCA peels (trichloroacetic acid) which is a deeper peel to reach the source, change the skin pH (which kills off the bacteria – they cannot survive in high acidity conditions), and increase skin regeneration by sloughing off several layers. TCA peels have been clinically prove to treat and cure acne better than any other treatment (including lasers and Accutane) without any of the horrible side effects).\n\nTCA peels used to be something only the wealthy could afford, but not anymore. You can still go to your doctor and pay $500+ or you can do it yourself. TCA peels are the easiest, safest, and most effective of all the skin peels and are now easily available.

I perform microsurgical vasectomy reversals I tell them. “Hmm” they say. “And so what else do you do?” “That’s it I explain. Just vasectomy reversals. One a day, every day. On men from every state in the US and from around the world.” “Hmm. That’s nice,” they respond…and then we get to the big question “Why does anyone want a Vasectomy Reversal (http://www.dadsagain.com/), anyway?”\n\nFirst of all, a little background: More than 600,000 men undergo a vasectomy each year in the US for permanent sterilization. Of those, about one of every twenty men (5%) will change their mind at some point. It could be 2 weeks later, or as in the case of my world-record patient, 42 years after vasectomy. But that’s what life is all about -surprises and change – sometime good surprises, sometime not so good. As I tell patients every week, life has a way of getting in the way of plans. Many men who wanted permanent sterilization, now find themselves wishing they could father children once again.\n\nThe good news is that for almost all men, a vasectomy reversal (http://www.dadsagain.com/vasectomy-reversal/) is an affordable and highly successful way to restore fertility. In fact, a review of several thousand of our own patients shows that we have been able to achieve more than a 90 to 96 % success, even for men who have had prior reversals! This same success rate is for all men, no matter how long ago they had their vasectomy. So this proves that the age old idea that the number of year from vasectomy to reversal determines success is hogwash.\n\nYet many doctors do not know or understand that a vasectomy reversal is highly successful when performed by a skilled and experienced microsurgeon.\n\nThe most common medical reason to have a reversal is for treatment of severe pain following a vasectomy, called post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS). This rare and devastating complication after a vasectomy occurs in less than 1 % of all vasectomies. For those unfortunate few men, the pain can be severe and debilitating. The pain can begin immediately after the vasectomy or can develop slowly over months and even years. The pain is believed to be a result of obstruction and a build up of fluid within the now sealed system. As the fluid builds up, the tissues become distended, causing stretching which causes significant pain. This pain can be especially severe after sexual activity. For many, the best option is microsurgical (http://dadsagain.com/resource-guide/microsurgical-vasectomy-reversal.html) reconnection of the ends of the vas, restoring flow and decompressing the system.\n\nI have many patients over the past 20 years that felt the need to restore the flow of sperm to the semen. Some felt that the vasectomy was unnatural and went against some deeper philosophies of life and fluids-in-balance. Some men have felt that they were not as healthy after the vasectomy and wanted to correct this with a reversal. Others just didn’t feel “right”. There was no specific complaint or change, they just weren’t the same and wanted to have their vasectomy reversed. Some felt that they wanted to restore their “energy” which they believe was changed by the vasectomy.\n\nThe good news is that whatever the reason, the chances for success are excellent, from 90 to 96%. At the International Center for Vasectomy Reversal, we are able to achieve a level of success that can only come from years of a full-time, single specialty vasectomy reversal practice – a practice with thousands of patients who travel to Tucson, Arizona each week from throughout the world. Drs. Marks and Burrows have the volume and experience to insure you get the best chances for a successful reversal. This is the reason so many trust ICVR for their vasectomy reversal."},{title:"Hiatal Hernia Overview",body:"Hernia generally involves penetration of the internal organs through the protective muscle walls that surround them. Depending on the organs involved in causing the disorder, there can be many different types of hernia. Hiatal hernia is a common type of hernia that occurs when the stomach wall presses against the esophageal hiatus, an opening in the diaphragm. The hiatus acts just like a valve, preventing the content of the stomach from reaching inside the esophagus. When the hiatus is weakened, the content of the stomach can be pushed upwards inside the esophagus, causing hiatal hernia. When the disorder occurs in the area above the diaphragm, it is referred to as sliding hiatal hernia. When the disorder occurs in the area below the diaphragm, it is referred to as paraesophageal hiatal hernia.\n\nHiatal hernia affects both sexes equally. Although it can occur at any age, the disorder has the highest incidence in elderly people. Hiatal hernia is also common in overweight people and in people who frequently sustain intense physical effort (weight lifting). Some people who suffer from hiatal hernia usually don’t have any symptoms at all. However, hiatal hernia can generate symptoms such as heartburn, abdominal pain and discomfort and nausea. Most people affected by hiatal hernia suffer from heartburn, which usually intensifies after meals. This common symptom of hiatal hernia occurs due to reflux of the stomach content inside the esophagus. When doctors suspect the presence of hiatal hernia in patients, they usually perform additional tests in order to confirm the clinical diagnose. Hiatal hernia can be revealed by X-ray scans, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and computerized tomography. Nowadays, the disorder can be quickly diagnosed with the means of a laparoscope. Unlike other forms of the disorder, hiatal hernia rarely requires surgery. In fact, in many cases hiatal hernia doesn’t require any medical treatment at all. When patients diagnosed with hiatal hernia complain about heartburn, doctors usually prescribe antacids or other similar medications. Corrective surgery is only required for patients with more serious, complicated forms of hiatal hernia. The surgical intervention is safe and quick, allowing patients to recover completely within a few days after the operation.\n\nUncomplicated hiatal hernia can be effectively cured by making lifestyle improvements. An appropriate diet and a healthy eating schedule have proved to be very effective ways of correcting hiatal hernia. Also, people who suffer from hiatal hernia are recommended to avoid weight lifting and straining in order to prevent complications.  Although it is very common, hiatal hernia is one of the least threatening forms of hernia and in many cases the disorder disappears on itself. However, if the symptoms generated by the disorder are ongoing or very intense, it is best to inform your physician about this."},{title:"The Truth About Hemorrhoids",body:"Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are an incredibly common medical condition and yet it is something which is rarely talked about. It is believed that 50% of Americans have this condition by the time they reach the age of 50 and yet only 500,000 of these people seek medical help for the problem. Of these, between 10 and 20% require surgery to have their hemorrhoids removed.\n\nHemorrhoids are caused by the veins in the rectum and anus becoming swollen and inflamed. The location of the piles can be internal or external and the symptoms vary dependent on this. If the hemorrhoids are internal, they can go undetected as pain receptors are not present internally. The only evidence of the problem can be blood in the bowel movements as they pass through the area. External piles are widely known to resemble a bunch of grapes and can be extremely painful for the sufferer. Of the two types, it would appear that internal hemorrhoids are the better of the two to have as you may not even know it. However, external piles can be easily treated whereas internal piles, when left undetected, can result in more serious complications.\n\nIf an internal hemorrhoid becomes severely distended over time it can be pushed out of the anus and so be visible externally. This is very unpleasant as it means that the internal passage is obstructed, making passing bowel movements difficult and painful. This is called prolapsed hemorrhoids. Once this has happened it is quite common for the anus to spasm and the sphincter can then trap the prolapsed hemorrhoid outside of the body. This then prevents the blood supply from reaching it and it becomes a strangulated hemorrhoid.\n\nCauses of hemorrhoids can be due to genetic tendency or environmental factors. Some people are born with weak veins in their rectum and so there is little they can do to prevent it from happening. However, for others there are more wide ranging reasons behind the condition. Pregnancy is widely acknowledged to exacerbate the prevalence of hemorrhoids. During childbirth itself, the excessive straining can cause the problem to occur. This can also be the case when straining forcefully whilst in the bathroom. This can be prevented by increasing fibre in the diet, upping your water intake and reducing that of diuretic drinks. A diuretic generally contains caffeine and this actually dehydrates the body by the intake of the fluid. It is also recommended that you do not sit on the toilet for longer than necessary, for example if you are reading in the bathroom. The position in which you sit on the toilet can also increase the problem.\n\nMany people find that outbreaks of piles can be treated by undertaking the same habits as I suggested to prevent them in the first place. Topical creams are also available which can soothe the area and encourage a reduction in the swelling. Once the swelling has gone down, the hemorrhoids are able to retreat back into the body. However, should these treatments not work within a matter of days, or should you experience prolonged or regular bouts of haemorrhoids you should seek medical attention from your doctor."},{title:"Old Fashioned Recipe For Preventing Allergies And Chemical Sensitivities",body:"Allergies and chemical sensitivities are a symptom of a compromised immune system.\n\nCandida overgrowth in the body may be the precursor to immune dysfunction causing all kinds of illness and allergies to food, pollen and multiple chemical sensitivities. Antibiotics, sugar and refined carbohydrates help create and grow this problem.\n\nCandida lives in balance with beneficial bacteria in the colon. The colon is vital for nutrient absorption and toxin elimination and one of its key contributions is the ability to break down the foods we eat. It is the first line of defense for the immune system.\n\nFood is broken down in the colon with the help of enzymes, yeast and beneficial bacteria that live there; they help keep the colon healthy.\n\nAntibiotics kill germs but they also kill the good bacteria in the colon. This results in less bacteria creating an imbalance, allowing Candida (yeast), to dominate. Candida continues to grow out of balance when there is too much sugar in the diet, whether it comes from refined sugar or high glycemic carbohydrates like fruit, carrots or bread.\n\nMy theory is that Candida overgrowth in the colon starts interfering with the body’s ability to absorb nutrients, resulting in less than optimal functioning of the organs and the immune system. In addition, a poorly functioning colon is not able eliminate toxins as well and the compromise snowballs.\n\nAdding beneficial bacteria (probiotics) and fiber to the diet are very helpful. Cultured foods like kefir, cultured vegetables and beverages are very effective at delivering the beneficial bacteria to the colon intact. Getting the good bacteria from cultured food not only replenishes the colon, but the fermentation/culturing process enhances the nutrition in the food, and predigests it, providing super nutrition, which is very helpful especially while the gut is healing.\n\nEliminating sugar and high glycemic carbohydrates is crucial and will help starve the Candida.\n\n(Note about sugar: One way that doctors can identify cancer cells is by the amount of glucose a cell consumes. Apparently, cancer cells also require more sugar!)\n\nChemical sensitivity also develops when the immune system is not functioning properly. Examples may be severe reactions to fragrances, petrochemical products, pollution, treated fabrics and preservatives along with many other chemicals in our environment.\n\nAir purifiers that have a filter made with coconut shell carbon and zeolite can provide dramatic relief and create a less reactive place inside the home.\n\nEliminating household chemical cleaners, pesticides, lawn care chemicals and body care products and replacing them with healthier alternatives is extremely helpful and easy to do.\n\nBut remember, with the right nourishment, the body can heal itself, resist disease and fend off toxins much more easily. Pharmaceuticals and air purifiers may provide relief, but do not solve the problem.\n\nRebuilding the body’s immune system can bring lasting results.\n\nRecipe for creating health:\n\nConcentrate on creating health.\n\nStart with the colon. Add fiber to the diet, cut out processed food, sugar, and high glycemic carbohydrates. Do not use artificial sugar… use Stevia instead. Stevia is an herbal supplement that is very sweet, works well as a sugar substitute and is actually health promoting.\n\nDrink lots of water, plain clean water. Water is so effective at eliminating toxins from the body, cleaning out the sinuses, and rinsing away cellular waste. It is a wonderful energy booster too. Other liquids do not make up for water. One cup of coffee results in the need for more water because caffeine is a diuretic and lowers the body’s water reserves. Hunger pains may actually be the body’s need for water. Water helps eliminate body fat and promote lean body tissue.\n\nFor extra support in allergy season, 8 to 10 glasses of water every single day will be helpful in reducing inflammation in the sinuses, preventing headaches and thinning mucus.\n\nEat lots of cultured vegetables, kefir, and drink probiotic liquids every day to support colon health, rebalance the yeast overgrowth and support the immune system. (Candida can live in the sinuses, along with other parts of the body, interfering as it grows.)\n\nEliminate soy (it can suppress thyroid function) and cook with coconut oil. Coconut oil and whole fat coconut milk is antiparasitic, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal. It supports the thyroid, fights Candida and boosts the immune system.\n\nDaily intake of cod liver oil, that is free from soy or synthetic ingredients, helps support certain hormones in the body that are a factor in controlling allergic reactions.\n\nTry to eat only organic food. Fats, like butter, contain vitamin A, which is very helpful for the respiratory system.\n\nNutrition for healing the body…it just makes sense."},{title:"Tips For Preventing And Controlling High Blood Pressure",body:"A healthy lifestyle can help people with various disorders and diseases better control them, gaining a better quality of life. High blood pressure is one the diseases that can be better controlled with a healthy lifestyle. In some people, a healthy lifestyle can prevent high blood pressure from developing. Many of us have heard over and over to “lose weight and get more exercise” because it will help a person to maintain better health. Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly can do a lot to help prevent and control high blood pressure. High blood pressure and a high weight are closely related. Being overweight significantly raises a person’s risk of developing high blood pressure. An overweight person raises their risk by as much as six times. But, as a person starts to take the extra pounds off, their blood pressure typically goes down too. Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and lean protein.  Exercise is another important factor in preventing and controlling high blood pressure (http://www.gothypertension.com/managing/highbloodpressureandexercise). Exercising makes the heart stronger and enables it to pump blood throughout the body with less effort. The easier it is for the heart to pump blood, the easier it is on the arteries. Regular physical activity helps a person reach and maintain a healthy weight. The latest federal guidelines suggest a person engage in moderate physical activity 30-60 minutes a day, 5-7 days a week. Walking is a good physical activity, especially for people just starting an exercise routine. Swimming, biking, and jogging are also great forms of exercise. In addition, federal guidelines suggest a person engage in vigorous physical activities, such as strength training, three times a week for at least 20 minutes each time.  Smoking is hard on the heart and nicotine cases the blood vessels to constrict, narrowing the blood vessels and making the heart work harder to pump blood through the body. Smoking also interferes with some blood pressure medications, making them much less effective. Quitting smoking reduces the risk for high blood pressure, will help to control existing high blood pressure, and will also reduce a person’s risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease, and having a stroke. Quitting smoking is very difficult, possibly the hardest thing a person will ever do, but doing so goes a long way towards improving a person’s health. \n\nAvoiding excessive sodium is suggested to help control and prevent high blood pressure, although there has been controversy in recent years about whether or not reducing sodium intake will have much of an effect on blood pressure. It may not have a big impact, but even a small reduction in sodium can have a positive effect on a person’s health. Take any prescribed high blood pressure medications as directed – don’t skip doses or quit taking it entirely. If, after being on medication for a period of time blood pressure returns to normal levels, it does not mean that person’s blood pressure has become normal. It means the medication is doing its job and is controlling the blood pressure. Blood pressure medication needs to be taking indefinitely, often for life. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Not only can it cause high blood pressure, it’s also bad for the liver and kidneys. Although studies have not proven whether or not caffeine affects high blood pressure, some studies have shown that people who regularly consume caffeine each day have higher blood pressure than people who don’t. On the other hand, some studies have shown that people eventually develop a tolerance to caffeine and that it then no longer affects their blood pressure. As a precautionary measure, physicians will usually advice patients with high blood pressure to limit their caffeine intake.

Homeopathy is derived from the Greek words homios, meaning like or similar, and italios, meaning suffering. Homeopathy is concerned with treating the whole person rather than the illness alone. The homeopath will consider the patient as a whole, both physically and psychologically, taking into account the patient’s physical appearance, their likes, dislikes and their temperament. It is there fore a highly personalized form of treatment, so patients who apparently suffer from the same ill ness may be given advice for different medicines. Homeopathy is a well established form of healing. Today many of the leading pharmaceutical companies are researching and mass-producing homeopathic medicines.\n\nHomeopathic Medicines\n\nHomeopathic medicines look very much like conventional medicines, are taken in the same way, but the way they work is entirely different. The medicines are not synthetic and are derived from natural sources. Over 60% of homeopathic remedies are prepared from vegetable or plant materials. Other remedies are prepared from naturally occurring mineral substances, including metals, non-metallic substances, and mineral salts. Animal sources of homeopathic remedies include: Cuttlefish (the ink or juice provides sepia) and Honeybee. Homeopathic medicines are prepared by obtaining the remedy in its most concentrated form, and then, through a long process of dilution, by preparing a medicine whose potency is sufficient to effect a treatment. The potency describes the measure of the dilution of the remedy and is denoted by the number which follows the name of the medicine itself. The higher the number, the greater the dilution (up to one part remedy to one trillion parts dilutant). Homeopathic Medicines\n\nHomeopathic medicines, commonly referred to as remedies, may come from the plant, mineral, or animal kingdom. Some common remedies include: arnica montana, from the Leopard’s bane plant; belladonna, from the deadly nightshade plant; calcarea, calcium carbonate from oyster shells; sepia, from cuttlefish ink; and the element, sulphur.\n\nHomeopathic remedies today are produced using the same dilution principles as in Hahnemann’s day. In a common dilution of 1:100, one drop of the homeopathic substance is added to 99 drops of water and/or alcohol. The mixture is then potentized by a process called “succussion” – repeated tapping on a hard surface for a specific length of time. Remedies may be diluted up to 1000 times, leaving only an infinitesimal trace of the substance. Remedies are typically diluted 10, 100, or 1,000 times, which translate into potencies that are marked with the Roman numerals X, C, and M. Homeopathic remedies range from 6X as the lowest potency to 1M or more as the highest potency.\n\nRemedies can be taken orally in pill, powder, or drop form, rubbed topically, or injected. There are usually no side effects from homeopathic treatments, but a patient can experience what is called a “healing aggravation,” a temporary accentuation of symptoms. This is seen as a positive sign that the remedy is working. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, a homeopath may choose an antidote, which produces the opposite effect of the remedy. The antidote may be another homeopathic remedy, or a strong substance, such as perfume, camphor, or coffee, which are known to block the effects of a remedy.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized homeopathic medicines as drugs since 1938, working with the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention to produce and update their reference book of homeopathic medicines. Over the years, the FDA has classified homeopathic medicines as either prescription or more commonly as non-prescription (over-the-counter), depending on their strength. In the United Kingdom, homeopathic medicine has been part of the National Health Service (NHS) since it began in 1948. There are currently 5 homeopathic hospitals in the NHS. Homeopathic medicines are available over-the-counter or by prescription.\n\nSafety of Homeopathic Medicines\n\nBecause of the very, very small doses used in homeopathic treatment, the medicines are completely safe, non-addictive and have no unwanted side effects. The curative properties of the remedies are released even in extremely high dilution\n\nIncoming search terms:homeopathic medicine from rpl     	"},{title:"Cutting Prescription Drug Costs",body:"There are a number of ways to cut prescription drug costs-without sacrificing safety or effectiveness. Try these tips:\n\n• What’s In A Name?-Finding generic versions of name-brand drugs can cut costs by a significant percentage. For instance, people who take one of the more popular cholesterol-lowering drugs could save about $175 per prescription if they stuck to the generic versions. • Finding Generics-Your pharmacist or doctor can tell you if the generic version of a drug is readily available in the U.S. You can also check with groups such as 1-800-USAVERX. The company gets drugs from FDA and World Health Organization (WHO)-approved facilities overseas. These markets do not have the same pricing regulations and patent laws as those found in the U.S. As a result, the company can offer generic versions of name-brand drugs-even if those generic versions are not available in U.S. pharmacies-at lower prices. Additionally, it offers name-brand drugs at significant discounts (about 60 percent) compared to U.S. prices. For instance, Nexium is sold in the U.S. at a price of about $420 per 100 pills. The company offers the same pills for about $320. The generic version of the drug sells for about $200. Similarly, those taking a name-brand arthritis drug that sells for about $260 in the U.S. could get the same drug for about $180 from the company. The generic version would cost about $105. In addition, people can visit the site for discounts on Lipitor, Plavix and Fosamax. The site also carries lower-priced versions of brand-name HIV/AIDS drugs as well as generic versions of the drugs that are not available in the U.S. The site gets its HIV/AIDS drugs from the same companies that sell the drugs to the Clinton Foundation’s AIDS project.\n\nAll the drugs offered on the site are priced lower than they are on the Medicare prescription drug plan and it offers the most popular medications for your pets as well. • Safe Alternatives-The company deals only with drug facilities that are approved by the FDA and the WHO, meaning the safety and efficacy of its drugs are strictly regulated. Additionally, the brand names it offers are identical to the brand names available in the U.S. Also, the company only deals with people who have prescriptions from doctors. • An Ounce Of Prevention-Taking steps to control your health may also help control your drug costs. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage your condition or to prevent health problems from happening in the first place. Simple things, such as exercising regularly and eating a balanced, lower-fat diet, could help keep you and your wallet in shape."
},{title:"Skin Cancer Prevention 5 Ways To Protect Yourself From Uv Rays",body:"Skin cancer prevention measures can actively reduce your chances of developing skin cancer if you implement them in your daily routine. The most common form of cancer in the United States, tens of thousands of Americans contract skin cancer every year.\n\nSkin cancer comes in three forms: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. Of the three, melanoma is the most dangerous and life threatening. Skin cancer claims the lives of approximately ten thousand Americans on an annual basis.\n\nWhat causes skin cancer?\n\nOverexposure to ultraviolet sunlight (UV rays) is believed to be the dominant external factor in a person’s development of skin cancer, although genetic factors can play a role. To protect yourself from UV rays, you should take the following 5 steps for proper skin cancer prevention:\n\n1. Avoid Direct Sun Exposure: Avoid exposing your skin to direct sunlight during midday (generally from 10am to 4pm). This is the time when UV rays are most intense. Plan your schedule to avoid outdoor activities during these hours. Also, be aware that sand and snow reflect sunlight, so if you’re at the beach or a ski resort, direct sunlight can bombard you from every direction with UV rays.\n\n2. Cover Yourself: When out in the sun, keep your skin covered. Wear long-sleeves and long pants if possible. Wearing a hat with a 3 to 4 inch brim all around is preferable. This will guard your neck and cheeks from dangerous prolonged exposure. Also note that dry, dark-colored garments offer the best protection.\n\n3. Use Sunscreen Properly: You should always use sunscreen when enduring prolonged exposure in the sun. Find a sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor of at least 15 and read the directions for proper application. The higher the SPF, the higher the protection you will receive against dangerous sunburns. However, sunscreen does not offer “bulletproof” protection, and UV rays can penetrate water, so just because you feel “cool” in the water doesn’t mean you’re protected from sunburn.\n\n4. Use Sunglasses That Block UV Rays: Making certain your sunglasses can block UV rays helps to guard your eyes from serious sun damage. The best constructed sunglasses should have a UV ray absorption rate of 99% to 100%. Never assume that darker lenses equal increased protection. UV rays are blocked by a chemical applied to the lenses. This chemical has nothing to do with the color of transparency of sunglass lenses.\n\n5. Stay Away From Tanning Beds: It is a myth to believe that tanning beds and sunlamps are free of harmful UV rays. These cosmetic instruments might make your skin more attractive in the short-term, but they can significantly increase your risk of developing skin cancer in the long-term. Health professionals advise their patients to avoid them.\n\nBy implementing these 5 steps in your daily routine, you can significantly decrease your risk of developing skin cancer, while maintaining a healthy lifestyle that allows for proper exposure to the sun. Another important step in prevention of skin cancer is routine examination by a doctor. If skin cancer is detected early, then your odds of survival are markedly increased."},{title:"The Terrible Truth About Acid Reflux Disease",body:"First of all, acid reflux is not a disease.  It is an acquired condition which can be completely healed by eating properly. I wonder if people had acid reflux, gerd and heartburn a thousand years ago. I sincerely doubt it. I believe it is a symptom of the quality of the food we eat today, our eating habits and the stressful times in which we live.\n\nPeople who eat convenience food on the run can’t expect to enjoy proper digestion. Proper digestion requires chewing food well and not diluting the digestive juices with liquids, the worst of these being carbonated beverages. And of course all the fat associated with convenience food makes the situation worse. Most people who go to fast food chains eat a burger with fries and a large soda. The employees are trained to push the soft drinks on the customers. They look at you as if you are nuts if you opt to skip the big soft drink.\n\nPeople today are always in a hurry, always late, both parents working and commuting to those jobs. There seems to be no time to shop for and prepare quality food. Children are forced to be self sufficient from an early age. They prepare their own meals, microwaving food which has little food value and is loaded with sodium and fat. \n\nWe are raising a generation of future acid refluxers. The parents are no better off, grabbing junk food to eat in the office. No wonder so many people suffer from acid reflux. I’m sure that the big pharma are thrilled at the prospects of future sales.  The medical community wants us to believe that only prescription drugs are the answer for the symptoms of indigestion. Of course this is not true. Antacids are, at best, a temporary fix and they are loaded with harmful ingredients such as sodium and aluminum. PPI drugs (proton pump inhibitors) like Nexium and Prilosec should only be used for eight weeks, at most. It says so right on the package, but after eight weeks what are we to do? Furthermore, these drugs only mask and hide the symptoms and have hundreds of harmful side effects. They don’t heal the condition! They only make the drug makers rich at our expense!\n\nI used to suffer from acute GERD. I confess that I too ate on the run. I didn’t chew my food properly. I washed everything down with soda and became addicted to a PPI drug – that purple pill.  It was so easy and convenient. I could abuse my body and not suffer for it. I thought that drug was my salvation until that illusion came crashing down on me. \n\nAfter several years of taking this drug, my condition became worse and I was told to double the dose. I began to feel sluggish and tired. My vision suffered and my blood pressure soared. I realized that these were probably side effects of this PPI drug.  Perhaps I was suffering from malnutrition? How does the body digest and assimilate food without stomach acid?\n\nI did a computer search and found that there were hundreds of possible side effects. I was shocked at what I found! I was harming my body and I wanted to stop taking this drug! But when I tried to stop taking the PPI, the acid pumps, which had been shut off, went wild and produced more acid than ever before. I can’t tell you how much I suffered. My esophagus was constantly burning and l feared that I would suffer permanent damage. I couldn’t sleep at night. I was afraid to eat or drink anything but water. My friends didn’t understand my problem. They would call and say, “Let’s go out for Southwestern barbeque”. Of course, I couldn’t. I loved to eat hot chili sprinkled with raw onions and jack cheese, but it was now my worst nightmare. My life was becoming unbearable!\n\nI was determined to beat this illness. My doctor couldn’t help me – no one could tell me what to do. I had to heal myself. I became completely dedicated to finding the answers. I studied and researched. I wanted to discover naturopathic treatments as opposed to drugs. I searched high and low for natural remedies that might actually cure acid reflux. I tried every possible remedy and healthy diet I could find. I made myself a virtual guinea pig.\n\nIn the end, I found that the answers to the acid reflux problem are really quite simple. With a few changes in lifestyle and with the help of natural remedies, one can absolutely beat the acid reflux syndrome, without the use of drugs.\n\nRemember, that the reason this condition exists in the first place, is due to a damaged esophagus. Let the esophagus heal by not eating the same foods in the same way that caused the damage.  Loosing weight, exercising, chewing properly, drinking sufficient amounts of water and elevating the head at night, are all simple things that anyone can do to improve this condition. There are also many natural ingredients found in any health store, which can help during, what I call, the acid reflux recovery period. Herbs, such as slippery elm and marshmallow have wonderful healing properties. Aloe vera juice, licorice and natural honey can sooth the esophagus and assist in the healing process.\n\nI had to take control of my life and assume responsibility for my own actions. I managed to turn things around. I did heal myself of the acid reflux condition. With a little knowledge and discipline, anyone can do the same.

They start off like a small microscopic particle and after a period of time develop into stones. These are formed when urine is highly concentrated. Due to this level of concentration the minerals and other floating particles in urine form into crystals which over a period of time turn into hard mass and later into a stone. Finding out kidney stones is not that easy as there may not be any sign or symptom to detect it. These stones cause lot of pain when it happens to break and move towards the bladder. The stones tend to pass out from the body which causes pain. If the stone happens to be big it may block the flow of urine causing pressure. This pressure causes stretches and spasms which pains a lot.\n\nSome of the different kinds of stones found in our body are\n\n*Calcium Stones is one of the most common stones found in the body. Due to excess calcium in urine these stones are formed.\n\n*Uric Acid Stone is nearly found in 10% of patients. Due to digestion uric acid is produced. If the acid level reaches beyond a certain level or is excreted, it may not dissolve resulting in formation of uric acid stones\n\n*Struvite Stones are known as the infection stone. These are developed when urinary tract infections leads to a chemical imbalance of urine, enabling the bacteria to spread quickly and developing into these stones.\n\n*Cystine Stones are one of the rarest stones to be found in aperson. It is an amino acid, which is built in urine to form a stone. The disease which causes cystine stones is hereditary and one should take extra care for that.\n\nSome ways due to which cystine stones are removed is by surgery. These are some of the ways to surgically remove the stones.\n\n* Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) * PCN (percutaneous nephrolithotomy-lithotripsy) * Endourology (endoscopic removal or manipulation)\n\n* Parathyroid surgery\n\n* Ureteroscopic stone removal\n\n* Open surgery\n\nBy avoiding some of these things in your routine life you would skip surgery completely.

The lack of symptoms is why some people who are aware they have high blood pressure do not take any steps to control and treat it. Because they feel okay they think everything is okay. But if high blood pressure is left untreated, serious problems may develop over time. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause strokes. As high blood pressure causes a person’s arteries to get narrower and narrower, it is harder for blood to get to the brain. That can potentially cause blot clots in the brain, cause a blood vessel in the brain to leak, or cause a blood vessel in the brain to rupture. Kidney disease (http://www.gothypertension.com/hypertension/hypertensionandkidneyfailure)can occur if high blood pressure is left untreated. If the arteries in the body are narrowed from sustained high blood pressure, the impaired flow of blood throughout the body can cause waste to build up in the blood because it is not getting to the kidneys often enough to discard all the waste products. As the waste builds up, it becomes more and more difficult for the kidneys to try and get rid of the waste, putting a big strain on the kidneys. This can cause the kidney functions to greatly diminish or even fail entirely. If the kidneys start to function at less than twenty percent of capacity, dialysis treatments will usually be needed. A kidney transplant would be an option to avoid having to get lifetime dialysis treatments if the person is a candidate for a transplant and a kidney becomes available. Problems with a person’s eyes can also occur as a result of untreated high blood pressure, causing a loss of vision if it gets severe enough. High blood pressure can also lead to memory loss and dementia. Heart problems are another serious problem that can develop if high blood pressure is left untreated. The arteries in the heart can become hard and stiff from restricted blood flow, causing a condition called arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). It is common for people with untreated high blood pressure to have plaque accumulate in the major arteries of the heart. The plaque deposits reduce blood flow to the heart and can eventually cause a heart attack. High blood pressure narrows the arteries and blood vessels in the body. Getting oxygen rich blood to the heart becomes more difficult as the arteries get narrower. If the heart cannot get enough oxygen, it will cause a heart attack."},{title:"Your Antibiotic One Day To 10 Day Options",body:"When you’re sick, listen to your mother: go see your doctor and find out what illness you have and how to get better. If you’re diagnosed with a bacterial infection, your doctor can provide a host of treatment options, which may include antibiotics. To treat a bacterial illness such as sinusitis or an ear infection, your doctor might prescribe a regimen of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and help you feel better faster. Antibiotics come in several dosing schedules ranging from a single dose, to twice a day up to multiple doses a day for more than a week. You may be tempted to ask your doctor for a medication with the fewest number of doses, but there are other factors your doctor may consider. When your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, he or she will consider the drug’s efficacy in treating the specific infection and the potential side effects to determine the best medicine for you. Among the commonly prescribed antibiotics are cephalosporins, some of which are effective against sinusitis, skin infections, ear infections and other bacterial infections, and are generally well-tolerated. Your doctor may determine that single-dose medicines are not necessarily the best for your infection. One-day doses may not be currently recommended by expert guidelines as good treatment options for your infection. If these medicines do not completely eliminate the infection and the infection remains, it may become immune to the medicine leading to what experts call “antibiotic resistance.”\n\nRemembering to take the full course of a prescription is important even if you feel better after a few days. Taking the full course of the medicine maintains the effectiveness of the drug, killing the bacteria causing the infection, while helping to reduce the risk of resistance. If you suspect you may have a bacterial infection, talk to your doctor about the best antibiotic for you-especially one with convenient dosing options and one that is generally well-tolerated."},{title:"Genital Warts How To Avoid Them",body:"Genital warts are bad.

How to avoid genital warts? With the relationships we have now a days, unless we become aware, we will surely get in to some problem. All of us try to think that bad things happen to others and not us. But that is only wishful thinking. Better to be safe than regret afterwards. To prevent genital warts, let us first understand them.\n\nGenital warts- what are they?\n\nGenital warts are caused a group of virus called HPV. This HPV virus also causes the common arts found on other parts of our body. The difference is in the type. HPV are of more than hundred types. The virus that causes genital warts is different to the virus that causes other warts. Virus of the same family of HPV also causes cervical cancer in women. Genital warts- how do they occur?\n\nHPV virus is transmitted by sexual contact. It can spread both by vaginal and anal sex. After you catch the virus you may not develop any warts for months or years. You are a silent carrier yourself unaware that you have contacted HPV. When the warts appear they will appear singly or in a bunch. They look skin colored bumps and form cauliflower shape.\n\nGenital warts in women- In men the warts are seen but if they form in a woman’s vagina, they will not be seen unless a doctor examines her. These warts spread very fast in the genitalia of women because the virus thrives in the moist warm surroundings.\n\nTo protect yourself from getting HPV, always use condoms and try to keep a monogamous relationship.

The volume of business is expected to be millions of prescriptions filled every year. And during recent elections, many candidates ran on platforms seeking to legalize the practice that many citizens are engaging in whether it is illegal or not.\n\nTo combat both the election hopefuls and the United States citizens who are currently ignoring the pricy prescription drugs on American shelves, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America is claiming that many imported drugs are unsafe. There is more evidence to the contrary, however.\n\nMany of the prescription drugs that are available on American pharmacy shelves quite legally, are already manufactured in and shipped from foreign countries. This is counter to the PRMA’s assertions that imported drugs are unfit or dangerous. Many industry insiders agree that the association is representing solely the interests of American pharmaceutical companies, who directly benefit from inflated drug prices. Like many other countries, Canada’s prescription drugs, like the prescription drugs of every industrialized nation with the exception of the United States, are kept relatively inexpensive due to price controls.\n\nThe FDA is in step with the PRMA, although it is similarly vague in assertions that buying prescription drugs in Canada is dangerous. In an interview with Kiplinger’s, William Hubbard, the FDA’s associate commissioner for policy and learning, stated “We know there are good drugs and bad drugs in Canada, but we can’t tell you which ones are which.” The fact is, most Canadian prescription drugs are not FDA approved, however Canadian food and drug standards are comparable to those of the United States’, and the argument that Canadian prescription drugs are unsafe, remains fairly unsupported. So far, the stream of American buyers seems to indicate the belief that buying prescription drugs from a reputable Canadian drug store is only dangerous to the large American pharmaceutical companies who have a vested interest in keeping drug prices high."},{title:"Diabetes Cause And Prevention",body:"An individual may get diabetes when the pancreas can no longer secrete the needed hormones that produce insulin. The insulin maintains the glucose in the blood to be normal. Low insulin means that the level of glucose, which is sugar in the blood, may get high and may lead to diabetes.\n\nThe autoimmune reaction is a type 1 diabetes where the cells in the pancreas organ that produces the needed insulin are destroyed. This results to the total loss of insulin in the hormones. This happens because the body has its own hormones that protects and destroys its own pancreas cells. Although there is no scientific proof why this occurrence in the pancreas happens, some studies have some theories that may possibly be related in this kind of reaction. Some say that this happens when there is exposure of a newly born to a cow’s milk, the infection from viruses and bacteria, and the exposure from food-borne chemical toxins. There is not enough evidence yet to prove some theories that may trigger the cause of diabetes.\n\nThe type 2 diabetes is said to progress when there is lack of insulin that is needed to maintain the blood sugar in the body. Another reason is believed to be that the needed insulin not be effective effective to control the blood sugar because of abnormalities in composition. The last reason is said to be that the receptors in cells no longer respond and fail to stimulate the organ that produces the needed insulin.\n\nAn individual is likely developing the type 2 diabetes when a person is overweight or obese. The increase of age of an individual is also considered a factor in acquiring this type of diabetes. Some few cases that may lead in this type of diabetes may include when a woman is having her pregnancy, or when a person have some intakes of medicines and drugs. In addition, any sickness or infectious decease that can alter the pancreas production of insulin.\n\nThere are some basic treatments for diabetes. These ways can serve an individual its important role in treating diabetes. Here are some ways on how a person can treat diabetes problems. 1. An individual must work thoroughly in obtaining his ideal body weight. Every individual must have a regular exercise and physical endurance tests. People who suffer from diabetes are recommended to be physically fit if possible. Exercises for the lungs and heart may help the person lessen the sugar that causes diabetes.\n\n2. An individual must follow a diabetic diet program. Not being on the proper diet can be a great factor in acquiring type 2 diabetes. It is recommended that a person must lose weight if he is an overweight person. It is advisable that a person must be conscious of the food that he takes. Eat foods that do not have sugar content. 3. The option of the individual to have medication and seek the help of a doctor. Every diabetes patients that have type1 and type 2 diabetes can take insulin daily to sustain the insulin production of the pancreas. There is also the new insulin pump that continuously provides the much-needed insulin. There are also new medications that treat diabetes like the synthetic human insulin, Sulfonylurea drugs, Biguanides, Thiazolidinediones, Meglitinides, Alpha-glucosidase, and other drug combinations.\n\nDiabetes can be prevented with the proper awareness and information regarding this illness.

This method was introduced to the public only in the recent years and is considered to be a rather modern and even innovation method.\n\nThe laser quit smoking system is based upon a simple and very old principle. It is a well known fact that certain point in human body are nerve centers and they can encourage changes in the body. This principle is used in many disciplines such as acupuncture, reflexology, shiatsu and more. The point is, if you apply pressure to certain points in human body, you can get certain predictable effects.\n\nThis principle is used in stop smoking laser treatment. Low intensity laser beam is applied to those specific point in your body. The result is an almost immediate reduction of the cravings that accompany the smoking cessation.\n\nThis way you can go through the first stages of quitting smoking without the cravings associated with them.\n\nNaturally, reducing the cravings is not always enough, as there are more aspects to quitting smoking. Therefore, the laser treatment goes very well along with behavioral therapy that will eliminate the psychological aspects of addiction. The laser simply deals with the physical Nicotine addiction.\n\nThe treatment is very “clean” and has no side effects, like some of the medications people take to quit smoking.\n\nSo, is Laser treatment to quit smoking a good idea for you?\n\nWell, you must consider the following:\n\n* It could be quit expensive. Prices very, and you should compare a few clinics before choosing. Some health insurances cover the cost of this treatment, so check it with your health insurance.\n\n* You should plan to combine the laser treatment with behavioral therapy. Undergoing a laser treatment only will not give you good results in many cases.\n\nBesides from that, laser treatment to quit smoking is a good choice to make as a quit smoking aid. Just remember that you really have to want to quit in order to make it. Laser treatment will help, but it’s you that actually quits smoking."},{title:"What Are The Lasik Procedures",body:"The LASIK surgeon uses computer software to guide the IntraLase laser beam, which applies a series of tiny (3-micron-diameter) bubbles within the central layer of the cornea. The resulting corneal flap is created at a precise depth and diameter pre-determined by the surgeon. As occurs with a mechanical microkeratome, a small section of tissue at one edge of the flap is left uncut, forming a hinge that allows the surgeon to fold back the flap so that the cornea can be accessed and reshaped for vision correction.\n\nLASIK has proven to be a safe and effective method of laser eye surgery as recently published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology by Ophthalmologist Professor Michael O’Keeffe reporting the results of a long term study commenced in 1998 and 1999 whereby LASIK patients were followed for a period of 5 years.\n\nThe LASIK Procedure\n\n1. Anesthetic drops are applied to the eye.\n\n2. A protective flap is created and gently lifted by the surgeon, revealing the inner corneal tissue.\n\n3. Computer-controlled pulses of cool laser light are applied to the inner layers of your cornea. As the laser pulses, it makes a ticking sound. The inner corneal layer is reshaped with the laser to mimic your contact lens or glasses prescription.\n\n4. The surgeon gently replaces the flap and aligns it to its original position. It heals naturally and securely.\n\n5. Some patients may feel slight irritation for a few hours, but most are quite comfortable after a nap and rest.\n\nAre there Follow Ups after Lasik Treatment?\n\nMost patients are usually seen the day following the treatment and then at least 1 month and 3 months following the treatment. Some patients require more visits. Remember, we are available 24 hours a day when you have any questions, concerns or need attention.\n\nSo, we urge you to find out more about Lasik Surgery today!"},{title:"Can Flaxseed Cure Cancer",body:"The flax plant, an ancient crop, yields the fibre from which linen is woven, as well as seeds (linseed or flaxseed) and oil. The oil, also called linseed oil, has many industrial uses – it is an important ingredient in paints, varnishes and linoleum for example.\n\nLike olive, canola, and most other plant oils, flax seed oil is highly unsaturated and heart-healthy. Lignans and other flax seed components may also have antioxidant properties, which means they may reduce the activity of cell-damaging free radicals.\n\nRecently small studies of cancer patients who consumed flaxseeds have produced some encouraging results.\n\nIn one study men with prostate cancer who ate an ounce of ground flaxseeds (almost three tablespoons) a day as part of a very-low-fat diet were able to slow the progress of their cancers between the time they were diagnosed and the time of surgery. A similar study of women awaiting surgery for breast cancer found that those who ate a flaxseed muffin daily (with about four tablespoons of ground flaxseeds per muffin) had a slower tumor growth rate. Studies of animals, too, suggest some anti-cancer benefit from flaxseed. But it’s always difficult to know whether it’s the lignans that help, or some other element in the flaxseeds. And not all studies have yielded positive results.\n\nBesides lignans, flaxseeds and their oil are also the best food sources of an essential fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid. “Essential” means we must consume it, because our bodies cannot manufacture it. Essential fatty acids are important for cell membranes, blood pressure regulation, and other functions. Alpha-linolenic acid is an omega-3, similar to some of the fatty acids in fish oil. Like aspirin, omega-3s may reduce blood clotting, thus lessening the chance of a fatal heart attack.\n\nFlaxseeds and their oil may also lower total blood cholesterol, as well as LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.\n\nBut that should come as no big surprise, since any highly unsaturated oil will do that, particularly if substituted for saturated fats. The fiber in flaxseeds may also help against cholesterol, since it is soluble (similar to that in oats)."},{title:"Hearing Aids To Best Suit Your Needs",body:"Studies show that one-tenth of the American population is hearing-impaired. Over the years, hearing aids have helped a great deal in eliminating this deficiency.\n\nHearing aids are small audio devices which are attached to the ears. Most models now are “hidden” to a casual observer. They offer a superior sound quality which helps lessen, if not eliminate, the loss of hearing.\n\nAs technology evolves, the science behind manufacturing hearing aids have become more and more advanced.\n\nHere are the three basic types of hearing aids:\n\n1. Conventional hearing aids\n\nThese are the very first types and brands of hearing aids which were realeased in the market.\n\nAlthough not as technologically advanced as the programmable digital hearing aids, the conventional type can be adjusted in a way that will fit the user’s needs.\n\nWith this type, the volume is manually adjusted by the user. The sound can be turned up or down, depending on the softness or loudness of the source of sound.\n\nThe only minor disadvantage of this type of hearing aids is that if a person’s hearing loss level improves or worsens, it must be sent back to the manufacturer so that adjustments can be made.This can be quite inconvenient for the user.\n\n2. Programmable hearing aids\n\nThis is more advanced in terms of technology, as compared to the conventional type.\n\nProgrammable hearing aids have adjustable circuits which may be adjusted, depending on the user’s level of hearing.\n\nThe volume control is automatic, making life easier for the patient.\n\n3. Digital hearing aids\n\nDepending on the patient’s needs, a digital hearing aid may be ordered to suit a specific situation.\n\nThis is by far the best and most convenient type to use.\n\nThere are hearing health care professionals whose job is to find the hearing aid that will be beneficial for the user.\n\nThe patient’s lifestyle and level of hearing loss is considered when looking for the best hearing aid to buy.\n\nDigital hearing aids also feature an automatic volume control.\n\nHowever, it may take one or two visits to a health care professional before the settings of the hearing aid can be adjusted to the user’s satisfaction.\n\nPhysically, this type of hearing aid is easier to wear and is “kinder” to the ears.\n\nThe circuit within the hearing aid automatically increases or decreases the level of sound.\n\nThere is a microphone and an amplifier that gathers and adjusts the sound respectively.\n\nFinally, the speaker transmits the byproduct of the altered and digitally-enhanced sound to the user’s ears.\n\nThe downside is that this type of hearing aid is more expensive than the programmable and conventional hearing aids.\n\nStill, once you have invested in a digital hearing aid, it will surely be convenient for you and will fit into any lifestyle.\n\n4. Disposable hearing aids\n\nThis type offers the sound quality of a conventional hearing aid and is more cost-effective than its more technologically-advanced counterparts.\n\nDisposable hearing aids have a shorter shelf-life. They can last 40 days at most, and once the battery expires, a new one should be purchased.\n\nTo choose a hearing aid that is right for you, make sure that you consult your ear doctor or otologist/audiologist.\n\nWhen consulting a professional to choose the right hearing aid for you, give them an overview of your lifestyle and budget to determine the best hearing aid that will suit your needs.\n\nFinally, try it out for a few days and if you find that the hearing aid that you bought does not fit your ear, your needs and your way of living, go back to your health care professional so that another type can be purchased."},{title:"Is Lasik Right For Me",body:"The subject of LASIK is a very interesting one.

With so many choices, it can be tough to know which apnea treatment method works best and which does not. An individual who has been diagnosed with sleep apnea requires a prompt apnea treatment in order to avoid the serious complications that are often associated with the disorder. Among them, heart disease, a greater likelihood of a stroke or other serious medical condition.\n\nFirst and foremost on your mind when selecting an apnea treatment should be safety. Is the product or procedure safe? What type of risks or warnings are associated with its use? If you are considering the use of an anti-snoring device, this may help you to have better quality sleep but these products are not intended to be a cure for sleep apnea on their own. For instance, the Sleep Genie is a doctor recommended anti-snoring device that may help sufferers enjoy a better quality sleep. While supporting the jaw, it helps the mouth to remain closed using a comfortable nylon lycra blend. It is important to understand that the Sleep Genie is not intended to be a cure for sleep apnea, but rather a product that can help the sufferer to rest better throughout the night.. In addition, apnea sufferers who use the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine may benefit from the added use of the Sleep Genie, which helps to keep the mouth closed. Users of the CPAP machine need to sleep with their mouth closed in order to keep the air, provided by the machine, from escaping during sleep.\n\nOther natural sleep apnea treatment methods include the removal of household allergens with the help of air filtration devices, sleeping on your side instead of your back, giving up cigarettes and/or alcohol and paying close attention to your diet. Obesity is one of the leading causes of snoring, which is a direct sign of sleep apnea. Therefore, if you are overweight or have been diagnosed as being obese, it may be time to consider a medically supervised diet and exercise program as the next step in your apnea treatment search. In addition to being a good sleep apnea treatment, losing weight will help to improve your overall health.\n\nThis article is intended for informational purposes only.

She switched to contact lenses at 16. She is 21 now and told me yesterday that she is considering using her savings from her part-time job to get laser eye surgery.\n\nNow I wear glasses and can see that they are inconvenient at times. I tried contacts years ago, before the newest generation of soft daily wear lenses were developed. One day I will get around to trying them again. But I know nothing about laser eye surgery, so I told her I would find out more and then we could talk about it.\n\nI have summarised what I found in the paragraphs below.\n\nLaser eye surgery, or LASIK surgery (Laser Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis ) is one answer for those people who do not want to wear glasses all the time. The surgeon uses a laser to permanently change the shape of the cornea, the tough part at the front of the eye. Because the shape is changed, the eye’s own lens is more able to do all the focussing that’s necessary, reducing the need for glasses or contacts.\n\nThere are some risks attached to the procedure, as there are to all surgical procedures, but most patients are pleased with the results.\n\nYou do need to be aware of the specific risks and to weigh up how important these negative effects of Lasik surgery are to you.\n\nSome patients develop extended blind spots, they cannot see certain lines on a reading chart or when reading a book and have to move their heads to overcome this.\n\nIf you have very strong lenses, for either near sightedness, or long sightedness Lasik surgery may not be very successful.\n\nSome patients develop glare, halos and double vision. All of these symptoms can make life unbearable. Other patients lose vision in low contrast settings, like driving at dusk.\n\nYou may develop a severe case of Dry Eye Syndrome. This is a permanent condition that causes discomfort and occasional blurring of vision.\n\nThese risks put off a lot of potential patients from having laser eye surgery. They would certainly put me off, and I will do my best to persuade my daughter not to go ahead."},{title:"Home Remedies For Boils",body:"Boil is a localized collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue in the skin. It starts off as reddened tender area and over a period of time, the area around it becomes firm and hard. The center of the boil full of pus is soft and is filled with infection fighting white blood cells, bacteria and proteins that eradicate the infection. Finally the pus forms a head, which can be surgically opened or drained out through the surface of the skin.\n\nOne can not pinpoint the reason for the occurrence of boils. They can be caused by ingrown hair, any splinter or foreign object lodged in the skin or clogged sweat glands that become infected to name a few. Boils can happen to young and old alike. It is one of the common skin infections ranging from the severity of a pimple to an abscess. Boils can be treated either with home remedies or medications. Any painful boil that is not rapidly improving should be seen by the healthcare practitioner.\n\nThe primary treatment for boils is heat application in form of hot soaks or hot packs. Application of hot compress increases the circulation to the area, allowing the body to fight off the infection. 10 – 15 minutes of hot compress four to fives times a day will help to bring the boil to a head and encourage easy drainage. If you skin often breaks into boils, start cleaning your skin with an antiseptic soap. This could lessen frequent appearance of boils.\n\nRegular use of antibacterial soaps helps prevent bacteria from building up on the skin. This can reduce the chance for the hair follicles to become infected and prevent the formation of boils.\n\nIf hair follicles on the back of arms or in and around the thighs continue to be inflamed, regular use of a loofah can break up oil plugs and build up around the follicles.\n\nCysts often turn into boils. Cysts can be prevented by avoiding direct pressure or irritation on the buttock area when the hair follicle becomes inflamed. Regular soap and hot water cleaning and drying is helpful.\n\nSome of the home remedies for boils Juice of garlic or onion applied externally on boils helps to ripen them, break them and drain out the pus.\n\nA cupful of fresh bitter gourd juice mixed with a tsp of lime juice taken on an empty stomach daily treats this condition.\n\nMix 1 tsp of milk cream mixed with 1/2 tsp of vinegar and a pinch of turmeric powder to form a paste. When applied, it helps ripening the blood boils and heals them without becoming septic.\n\nGently warm a betal leaf till it becomes soft. Coat it with a layer of castor oil and put it over the inflamed part. Replace the leaf every few hours. Few applications of the castor oil coated betal leaf will rupture and drain out the boil.\n\nGround cumin seeds in water forming a paste. Apply the paste to the boils with beneficial results.\n\nSteep parsley in boiled water till it is soft and juicy. When hot, wrap it clean muslin or linen cloth and apply it on the boils.\n\nApplication of turmeric powder on the boils enables to ripen it and burst.\n\nThe reader of this article should exercise all precautions while following instructions on the recipes from this article.

In the typical CSSD of a hospital, surgical equipments and bandages and supplies are sterilized and cleansed and ready for re-use. The equipment for sterilization is called an autoclave or commonly called a sterilizer.\n\nA medical autoclave is a device that uses steam to sterilize equipment and other objects.\n\nBy sterilizing, all bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores are inactivated.\n\nThere are chemical and biological indicators that can be used to ensure an autoclave reached the correct temperature for the correct amount of time.\n\nChemical indicators can be found on medical packaging and autoclave tape, and these change color once the correct conditions have been met.

It was a tingling sensation-my legs would feel like something was crawling deep inside them. I felt like I had to move my legs and then would start tossing and turning. Sometimes, I had to get out of bed and walk to relieve the feelings. This would usually go on for quite some time, preventing me from falling asleep.” Beth knew that what she was experiencing wasn’t normal, so she started talking to others about her symptoms. At the time, her doctors did not know how to help her. Beth even thought the symptoms might be related to her diet or exercise habits. “I was frustrated. Night after night, I would feel the same creepy-crawly sensations in my legs, and getting up to relieve the feelings would keep me from falling asleep. Sometimes, I would get these sensations during the day if I was sitting for a long time: I couldn’t really sit and read, watch TV, go to the movies. Travel became difficult because I couldn’t sit for long periods of time on airplanes or in the car.”\n\nRecently, Beth saw an article about Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in a local newspaper. It described RLS as a common and disruptive neurological condition that is characterized by a compelling urge to move the legs and by uncomfortable or sometimes painful sensations in the legs. These sensations are frequently described as creeping-crawling, tingling, pulling or tightening in the legs.\n\nBeth wondered if this could be the same condition she had lived with for all these years. She brought the article to her doctor to help her describe what she was experiencing. After an examination, Beth’s physician diagnosed her with RLS, a recognized-and now treatable-medical condition.\n\n“I’m relieved to know that what I’ve been experiencing is a recognized medical condition. For me, my RLS diagnosis was an important step forward in my quest for relief from the disruptive creepy-crawly feelings that I had lived with for so long.”\n\nIn May 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Requip      "},{title:"Common Skin Care Myths",body:"With an increasing emphasis on beauty and age defiance in North American society, everyone seems to be seeking ways to make themselves appear younger by taking better care of their skin. While it is true that skin is one of the keys to a healthy, youthful appearance, not all skin care treatments that are proposed, or even that are popular, are effective. Here are some of the top myths when it comes to skin care.\n\n1) Acne. Acne is the bane of everyone from their teenage years and onward. There are so many false rumors out there concerning acne that an article could be written on them alone. To start with, acne does not cease miraculously when you are out of your teens. In some people, acne is a perpetual problem and will continue throughout their lives. Many of the false ideas about acne are extremely detrimental to people who are afflicted with the condition. Acne is not a sign that an individual does not wash their face. In fact, many individuals with acne will be told this by their peers and the result will be extremely counter-productive; they end up washing their faces too much. The dryer skin does not clear out the acne problem, instead it exacerbates it. Acne may be aggravated by certain foods in an individual’s diet, but rarely are the “suspect foods” (chocolate, French fries, or pizza) the main trigger. Finally, remember that acne can be treated by several types of medicine on the market today-and effectively- so it is all right to go to your doctor and consult her about acne treatments.\n\n2) Tanning. Tanning is often advertised as adding a warm, healthy glow to your skin. The truth is, nothing is worse for your skin than direct exposure to the harmful ultraviolet rays that are necessary to tan, whether you are on a bed or in the sun. Tanning may help to get rid of formed acne, but it will not prevent new pores from clogging. Tanning has little benefits beyond immediate aesthetic appeal, and in the long run it will prove harmful to your skin. It is best to use sun block whenever you are out in the sun.\n\n3) Moisturizers. Many people think that moisturizers will help in making their skin appear more youthful by getting rid of wrinkles. This is not the case. Moisturizers will help to lubricate the skin and lessen dryness, but they will not serve to repair the microscopic damage at the cell level that wrinkles represent. 4) Skin Care ingredients. For many years, top beauticians have placed slices of cucumber over the eyes of their clients in order to reduce skin damage and swelling. Today, you will find many products on the shelves that depict a cucumber or slice of cucumber and claim to include cucumber extracts that will help rejuvenate your skin. The fact is that it is not any particular mineral in the cucumber that is beneficial to the skin, it is the fact that cucumbers are mostly made of water, which leeches into the skin during the process and gives the appearance of re-invigoration.\n\nAll of these myths are used today to help sell products via a method known as scare tactics. In fact, if you follow the advice of your doctor most of your skin care needs will be resolved, and they will not require a lot of home grown methods and wives tale rumors."
},{title:"Male Menopause The Alternative Anti Aging Approach",body:"If you are a male over the age of 40 and are suffering from weakness, impotence, pain, stiffness, drooping muscles, depression, anxiety, or heat intolerance, you may be experiencing “andropause”.\n\nAndropause is a syndrome resulting from the deficiency of hormones, especially testosterone. It’s onset and symptoms may not be as dramatic as female “menopause”, but its effects can be just as serious. It is interesting that hormone replacement is quite routine in women but barely even addressed in men. The decline in hormone levels in both sexes has an adverse impact on one’s state of health. Starting around age 25, DHEA and testosterone levels begin a progressive downward trend. With falling hormones, it is much harder to maintain muscle mass. Things begin to sag and fat begins to form increasingly thick layers around the lower back and abdomen. Stamina is affected and exercise intolerance occurs. Osteoporosis is well-documented in women and occurs in men as well. This can result in hip and vertebral compression fractures. Wrinkles that carve deep crevices in the face are partially due to testosterone deficiency. Libido is reduced and even impotence may develop. These changes are all a result of male “menopause”.\n\nHormone replacement has been available for women for decades and the positive results continue to multiply. In Anti-Aging medicine, it is expected that maintenance of hormone levels in the youthful range (that of a 25-30 year old) will provide substantial health benefit. Proper monitoring of hormone replacement is a relatively recent innovation that makes this therapy much safer. We can now insure proper dosages in the accepted normal physiologic range. Cancer risk is greatly reduced by this refined approach to replacement therapy.\n\nThe decline in testosterone occurs as a result of multiple causes and treatment should be directed accordingly. Aromatase (an enzyme that converts Testosterone into Estradiol) increases as we gain years. This increases raises the free estrogens and lowers the free Testosterone. Prostate cancer is correlated with high circulating estrogens. Aromatase inhibitors, such as chrysin, nettle extract, and Arimidex can inhibit aromatse. Testicular atrophy leads to decreased testosterone production. A course of treatment with HCG stimulates testicular development and can boost Testosterone production. A complete vitamin, mineral, and antioxidant supplement plus a proper diet help to correct nutritional deficiencies. DHEA and possible melatonin replacement also serve as alternatives and as adjuncts to testosterone therapy. A diet that includes a large amount of legumes, especially soy, is helpful in providing the necessary building blocks for our bodies to manufacture hormones. Maintaining cholesterol in the normal range (not to high or to low) is also critical for hormone synthesis. Testosterone replacement can be accomplished by the use of creams, pills or even injection. It is best if the physiologic patterns natural to the body are mimicked, which makes injection less favorable. Creams containing natural testosterone are well absorbed through the skin, bypass metabolism by the liver, and are easy to apply, thus making them superior to pills. The potential risks of testosterone administration include increases in red cell mass, worsening of sleep apnea, changes in plasma lipid levels, and fluid retention. There is some concern that testosterone replacement might exacerbate benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). There is no change in PSA with testosterone therapy. You are not a candidate for this replacement therapy if you have an active testicular or prostate cancer. Finally, testosterone supplementation may produce adverse side effects if administered to men with normal levels, hence the importance of monitoring.\n\nWith proper replacement, you can expect to regain muscle mass, increase bone density, increase stamina, increase libido, reduce your risk for a variety of cancers and Alzheimer’s disease, and live an improved quality of life."},{title:"A Brief History Of Anesthetics",body:"Anesthetics have been used for thousands of years. In fact, the first recorded use of anesthetics was actually in the ‘pre-history’ era, an era of human history predating written text. Early Uses of Herbal Anesthetics\n\nIn the pre-history era, anesthetics were herbal in nature. Opium poppies are known to have been harvested as early as 4200 BC, and these plants were farmed first in the Sumerian Empire. The first recorded uses of anesthetics containing opium preparations was in 1500 BC, and by 1100 BC, civilizations in Cyprus and other locations were farming and harvesting the plants.\n\nOpium poppies were introduced to India and China in 330 BC and 600 to 1200 AD, respectively. Other types of herbal anesthetics were in use in China during this era as well. In the second century, the Chinese physician Hua Tuo is known to have used an anesthetic derived from cannabis to perform abdominal surgery. In Europe, Asia, and the Americas, several other ‘solanum’ plant species were used as anesthetics, including mandrake, henbane, and several datura species. Each of these contains a potent tropane alkaloid. In the classical Greek and Roman eras, prominent figures such as Hippocrates and Pliny the Elder noted the uses of opium and solanum-containing plants. In the Americas, the leaves of the coca plant (from which cocaine is derived) were an often-used anesthetic. This was applied by Incan shamans who would chew coca leaves and then spit the leaves into wounds to administer a local anesthetic.\n\nHerbal anesthetics of these types were widely used for several centuries; however they were not without drawbacks. One of the main problems with the use of herbal anesthetics was in administering the right dosage-too little would have no effect, and too much often killed the patient. Standardization of anesthetics was difficult, but was achieved to a certain degree prior to the nineteenth century by categorizing anesthetics according to the location in which anesthetic plants were grown.\n\nThe Discovery of Morphine\n\nIn 1804, a German pharmacist named Friedrich Wilhelm extracted morphine from the opium poppy, and named the compound ‘morphium’, for the Greek god of sleep and dreams. However, morphine was not widely used for nearly fifty years. In 1853, the hypodermic needle was developed, and thanks to this new method of administration, the use of morphine increased substantially. Morphine was then widely used as an anesthetic.\n\nIn 1874, a morphine derivative called diacetylmorphine-commonly known as heroin-was developed. Nearly twice as potent as morphine, heroin was marketed for a short time by Bayer, starting in 1898. However, it was just 16 years later in 1914 that the possession of morphine, heroin, and cocaine without a prescription was outlawed in the US due to the highly addictive nature of these substances.\n\nDevelopment of Inhalant Anesthetics\n\nOral and inhalant anesthetics were utilized historically by Muslim anesthesiologists, and the use of these preparations was well known in the Islamic Empire. Several hundred surgical operations were performed which used sponges soaked in narcotic preparations, placed over the face of the individual undergoing surgery.\n\nIn the Western world, the development of inhalant anesthetics, along with the use of sterile surgical techniques developed by Joseph Lister, was one of the main keys to performing successful surgery in the nineteenth century.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, both carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide were used in experimental surgical procedures. While the use of carbon dioxide as an anesthetic never became popular, nitrous oxide did in fact become very widely used.\n\nThe anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide were first noted by Humphry Davy, a British chemist, in a paper published in 1800. However, it was not until several decades later in the 1840s that nitrous oxide became more widely used. One of the first successful uses of the gas for painless tooth extraction was carried out by American dentist William Thomas Green Morton, in 1846.\n\nDuring the same decade, an inhalant anesthetic called diethyl ether was also used for tooth extraction. Diethyl ether was originally synthesized by German physician Valerius Cordus in 1540; however it was not until the 1840s that the first public demonstration of the use of ether occurred. A decade earlier, in the 1830s, chloroform had also been developed. This became more popular in Britain, but even so the dangers of both ether and chloroform were well-noted.\n\nModern Anesthetics\n\nModern anesthetics are of two types: general and local anesthetics. Local anesthetics include substances such as lidocaine and procaine. These work by preventing transmission of nerve impulses in the area where the anesthetic is administered. General anesthetics, on the other hand, are more similar in nature to nitrous oxide in their method of delivery, and in fact this inhalant anesthetic is still in use. Inhalation anesthetics are usually fluorochemicals (isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane) that have much lower flammability than diethyl ether, thus they are much safer to use in the operating room."},{title:"How To Quit Smoking Using Zyban",body:"In general, an addiction to smoking can be a very difficult one to overcome. Depending on how long you’ve smoked, how much you smoke, and genetic factors, you may find it extremely difficult to quit smoking. It is a well known fact the genetic factors are at play and determine how susceptible someone is to a nicotine addiction, and for this reason some people need more than their will power to quit smoking. There are medical aids to quit smoking that help address the body’s dependence on nicotine, leaving you to concentrate your will power on other aspects of the addiction: namely, the social associations you likely have with smoking.\n\nFor many years the standard medical stop-smoking aid was the nicotine patch, which is attached to the skin and releases a steady supply of nicotine to the bloodstream. Fairly recently, though, another approach has become popular: the use of the drug Zyban (bupropion hydrochloride.)\n\nZyban’s development as an anti-smoking aid is a curious one: it was originally designed as an anti-depressant, and during clinical trials of the drug is was discovered that as a side effect, many smokers participating in the trails lost interest in cigarettes and found it very easy to quit. Further research revealed that the drug was an effective stop-smoking aid, and it was approved for use as such in 1997 by the FDA.\n\nZyban works in a completely different way from the nicotine patch. Instead of supplying nicotine to the bloodstream, Zyban alters brain chemistry in such a way that the desire for smoking is greatly reduced – many people find that cigarettes simply become unappealing after taking the drug. At no point does Zyban supply or regulate nicotine in the bloodstream.\n\nTo work effectively, Zyban is usually taken a few weeks before you actually stop smoking. Like all anti-depressants, it takes time for its effects to manifest. Once you’ve been taking the drug for some time, you stop smoking, and if all goes well you’ll find the process much easier than an unaided attempt.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind, however, that Zyban is a prescription drug that alters brain chemistry – in fact researchers are not even exactly sure how it works, only that it does for many people. Naturally, you doctor will be consulted in your decision to take Zyban, and it is crucial that Zyban is not taken in combination with other drugs. Make sure you talk to your doctor about the possible side effects of using Zyban to quit smoking: some common side effects include insomnia, dizziness, and dry mouth. In rarer cases, more serious side effects like seizures can occur. You must also discuss with your doctor the situations in which Zyban should not be taken, like if you are abruptly stopping the use of alcohol, or have a history of seizures.\n\nWhile Zyban should be approached with some caution, as long as it is properly discussed with your doctor, it can be a very effective aid in your battle to quit smoking."},{title:"Lasik Surgery Frequently Asked Questions",body:"What is Lasik Surgery?\n\nLasik, an acronym for Laser-assisted, is a form of refractive laser eye surgery procedure performed by ophthalmologists intended for correcting vision. The procedure is usually a preferred alternative to photorefractive keratectomy, PRK, as it requires less time for full recovery, and the patient experiences less pain overall.\n\nThe Lasik Operation\n\nThe Lasik Operation is performed with the patient awake and mobile; however, the patient typically is given a mild sedative and anesthetic eye drops.\n\nLasik is performed in two steps. The initial step is to create a flap of corneal tissue. This process is achieved with a mechanical microkeratome using a metal blade, or a femtosecond laser microkeratome that creates a series of tiny closely arranged bubbles within the cornea. A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back, revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea.\n\nThe second step of the procedure is to use an excimer laser to remodel the corneal stroma. The laser vaporizes tissue in a finely controlled manner without damaging adjacent stroma by releasing the molecular bonds that hold the cells together. No burning with heat or actual cutting is required to ablate the tissue. The layers of tissue removed are tens of micrometers thick.\n\nCurrently manufactured excimer lasers use a computer system that tracks the patient’s eye position up to 4,000 times per second, redirecting laser pulses for precise placement. After the laser has reshaped the cornea, the Lasik flap is repositioned over the treatment area by the surgeon. The flap remains in position by natural adhesion until healing is completed.\n\nPerforming the laser ablation in the deeper corneal stroma and under the Lasik flap fools the cornea into not knowing that it has had surgery. The wound response is muted, thus the patient is typically provided rapid visual recovery and virtually no pain.\n\nWavefront-guided Lasik\n\nWavefront-guided Lasik is a variation of Lasik surgery where, rather than apply a simple correction of focusing power to the cornea (as in traditional Lasik), an ophthalmologist applies a spatially varying correction, using a computer- controlled high-power UV laser guided by measurements from a wavefront sensor.\n\nThe goal is to achieve a more optically perfect eye, though the final result still depends on the physician’s success at predicting changes which occur during healing. Nor are wavefront aberrations the factor to degrade vision; especially in older patients, scattering from microscopic particles plays a major role. Hence, patients expecting so-called “super vision” from such procedures may be disappointed. Surgeons claim patients are generally more satisfied with this technique than with previous methods, particularly regarding lowered incidence of “halos”, the visual artifact caused by spherical aberration induced in the eye by earlier methods.\n\nAlthough there have been a number of improvements in Lasik technology, a large body of conclusive evidence on the chances of long-term complications is not yet in place. Also, there is a small chance of complications, such as slipped flap, corneal infection, haziness, halo, or glare. The procedure is irreversible.\n\nThe incidence of macular hole has been estimated at 0.2% to 0.3%.\n\nThe incidence of retinal detachment has been estimated at 0.36%.\n\nThe incidence of choroidal neovascularization has been estimated at 0.33%.\n\nThe incidence of uveitis has been estimated at 0.18%.\n\nAlthough the cornea usually is thinner after Lasik because of the removal of part of the stroma, refractive surgeons strive to maintain a minimum thickness in order to not structurally weaken the cornea.\n\nDecreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes has not been shown to be extremely dangerous to the eyes of Lasik patients. However, some mountain climbers have experienced a myopic shift at extreme altitudes. Although there are no published reports documenting diving-related complications after Lasik, urban legends that describe eyes that have popped open during scuba diving still persist.\n\nThere are also concerns about possible Lasik-related problems with night vision, to the extent that some armed forces around the world advise aspiring air force and special forces personnel not to have the surgery."},{title:"Should You Take Prescription Medication For Anxiety Attacks",body:"Are you considering taking prescription medication to help “cure” the symptoms of your anxiety attacks? Let’s face it, we’ve all the seen the commercials from the various drug companies promising a simple “cure” for your anxiety attacks by taking prescription medication. \n\nHere’s what they don’t tell you:\n\n1.	Prescription medications mask the root problem of your anxiety attacks. Yes, you may have temporary relief of your symptoms but your anxiety attacks started for a reason. You need to discover the root problem in order to find the solution as to why your body is reacting with an anxiety attack instead of covering it up with medication.\n\n2.	Prescription medications are addictive, which can mean a long, agonizing withdrawal period when you want to get off them. You have to wean yourself off gradually and this process can cause your anxiety attack symptoms to worsen or other side affects to occur before you are completely off the prescription medication.\n\n3.	After long-term use of the prescription medication, you may find that you need higher doses in order to keep the medication functioning. You may end up returning to your doctor repeatedly, only to have him increase your dosage, or worse, prescribe a stronger medication for you.\n\nThe remarkable part about these drug prescription commercials is the disclaimer they ramble off quickly near the end listing the side affects that some of these prescription drugs can produce.  Are you truly prepared to risk your long-term health by taking these prescription medications?\n\nThe commercials make the “cure” sound so wonderful: take a pill and all your anxiety attack symptoms will be gone. It’s very tempting to be seduced into a quick-fix. However, you should take a pro-active approach and do further research before you buy into these so-called “cures”. There is massive information available on the internet about anxiety disorders as well as on specific prescription drugs and their side-effects. You should know that natural remedies do exist such as Chamomile tea or St. John’s Wort for relief of some anxiety attack symptoms. Moreover, you may find that an appointment with a Naturopathic doctor or a Hypno-Therapist to be a more natural solution than a visit to your family physician and his trust prescription pad.

Anxiety attacks are 100% curable; you only need to find the natural solution that is right for you."},{title:"What Is An Antioxidant",body:"An antioxidant is a chemical that reduces the rate of particular oxidation reactions in a specific context, where oxidation reactions are chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from a substance to an oxidising agent.\n\nAntioxidants are particularly important in the context of organic chemistry and biology: all living cells contain complex systems of antioxidant chemicals and/or enzymes to prevent chemical damage to the cells’ components by oxidation. The importance and complexity of antioxidants in biology is reflected in a medical literature of more than 142,000 scholarly articles.\n\nA diet containing antioxidants from plants are required for good health since plants are an important source of organic antioxidant chemicals. Antioxidants are widely used as ingredients in dietary supplements that are used for health purposes such as preventing cancer and heart disease. However, while many studies have suggested benefits for antioxidant supplements, several large clinical trials have failed to clearly demonstrate a benefit for the formulations tested, and excess supplementation may be harmful.\n\nAntioxidants are chemicals that reduce oxidative damage to cells and biochemicals. Researchers have found high correlation between oxidative damage and the occurrence of disease. For example, LDL oxidation is associated with cardiovascular disease. The process leading to atherogenesis, artherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease is complex, involving multiple chemical pathways and networks, but the precursor is LDL oxidation by free radicals, resulting in inflammation and formation of plaques.\n\nResearch suggests that consumption of antioxidant-rich foods reduces damage to cells and biochemicals from free radicals. This may slow down, prevent, or even reverse certain diseases that result from cellular damage, and perhaps even slow down the natural aging process.\n\nSince the discovery of vitamins, it has been recognized that antioxidants in the diet are essential for healthful lives. More recently, a large body of evidence has accumulated that suggests supplementation of the diet with various kinds of antioxidants can improve health and extend life.\n\nMany nutraceutical and health food companies now sell forms of antioxidants as dietary supplement. These supplements may include specific antioxidant chemicals, like resveratrol (from grape seeds), combinations of antioxidants, like the “ACES” products that contain beta carotene (provitamin A), vitamin C, vitamin E and Selenium, or specialty herbs that are known to contain antioxidants such as green tea and jiaogulan.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information presented here should not be interpreted as medical advice.

Finally, testosterone supplementation may produce adverse side effects if administered to men with normal levels, hence the importance of monitoring.\n\nWith proper replacement, you can expect to regain muscle mass, increase bone density, increase stamina, increase libido, reduce your risk for a variety of cancers and Alzheimer’s disease, and live an improved quality of life."},{title:"A Brief History Of Anesthetics",body:"Anesthetics have been used for thousands of years. In fact, the first recorded use of anesthetics was actually in the ‘pre-history’ era, an era of human history predating written text. Early Uses of Herbal Anesthetics\n\nIn the pre-history era, anesthetics were herbal in nature. Opium poppies are known to have been harvested as early as 4200 BC, and these plants were farmed first in the Sumerian Empire. The first recorded uses of anesthetics containing opium preparations was in 1500 BC, and by 1100 BC, civilizations in Cyprus and other locations were farming and harvesting the plants.\n\nOpium poppies were introduced to India and China in 330 BC and 600 to 1200 AD, respectively. Other types of herbal anesthetics were in use in China during this era as well. In the second century, the Chinese physician Hua Tuo is known to have used an anesthetic derived from cannabis to perform abdominal surgery. In Europe, Asia, and the Americas, several other ‘solanum’ plant species were used as anesthetics, including mandrake, henbane, and several datura species. Each of these contains a potent tropane alkaloid. In the classical Greek and Roman eras, prominent figures such as Hippocrates and Pliny the Elder noted the uses of opium and solanum-containing plants. In the Americas, the leaves of the coca plant (from which cocaine is derived) were an often-used anesthetic. This was applied by Incan shamans who would chew coca leaves and then spit the leaves into wounds to administer a local anesthetic.\n\nHerbal anesthetics of these types were widely used for several centuries; however they were not without drawbacks. One of the main problems with the use of herbal anesthetics was in administering the right dosage-too little would have no effect, and too much often killed the patient. Standardization of anesthetics was difficult, but was achieved to a certain degree prior to the nineteenth century by categorizing anesthetics according to the location in which anesthetic plants were grown.\n\nThe Discovery of Morphine\n\nIn 1804, a German pharmacist named Friedrich Wilhelm extracted morphine from the opium poppy, and named the compound ‘morphium’, for the Greek god of sleep and dreams. However, morphine was not widely used for nearly fifty years. In 1853, the hypodermic needle was developed, and thanks to this new method of administration, the use of morphine increased substantially. Morphine was then widely used as an anesthetic.\n\nIn 1874, a morphine derivative called diacetylmorphine-commonly known as heroin-was developed. Nearly twice as potent as morphine, heroin was marketed for a short time by Bayer, starting in 1898. However, it was just 16 years later in 1914 that the possession of morphine, heroin, and cocaine without a prescription was outlawed in the US due to the highly addictive nature of these substances.\n\nDevelopment of Inhalant Anesthetics\n\nOral and inhalant anesthetics were utilized historically by Muslim anesthesiologists, and the use of these preparations was well known in the Islamic Empire. Several hundred surgical operations were performed which used sponges soaked in narcotic preparations, placed over the face of the individual undergoing surgery.\n\nIn the Western world, the development of inhalant anesthetics, along with the use of sterile surgical techniques developed by Joseph Lister, was one of the main keys to performing successful surgery in the nineteenth century.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, both carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide were used in experimental surgical procedures. While the use of carbon dioxide as an anesthetic never became popular, nitrous oxide did in fact become very widely used.\n\nThe anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide were first noted by Humphry Davy, a British chemist, in a paper published in 1800. However, it was not until several decades later in the 1840s that nitrous oxide became more widely used. One of the first successful uses of the gas for painless tooth extraction was carried out by American dentist William Thomas Green Morton, in 1846.\n\nDuring the same decade, an inhalant anesthetic called diethyl ether was also used for tooth extraction. Diethyl ether was originally synthesized by German physician Valerius Cordus in 1540; however it was not until the 1840s that the first public demonstration of the use of ether occurred. A decade earlier, in the 1830s, chloroform had also been developed. This became more popular in Britain, but even so the dangers of both ether and chloroform were well-noted.\n\nModern Anesthetics\n\nModern anesthetics are of two types: general and local anesthetics. Local anesthetics include substances such as lidocaine and procaine. These work by preventing transmission of nerve impulses in the area where the anesthetic is administered. General anesthetics, on the other hand, are more similar in nature to nitrous oxide in their method of delivery, and in fact this inhalant anesthetic is still in use. Inhalation anesthetics are usually fluorochemicals (isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane) that have much lower flammability than diethyl ether, thus they are much safer to use in the operating room."
},{title:"How To Quit Smoking Using Zyban",body:"In general, an addiction to smoking can be a very difficult one to overcome. Depending on how long you’ve smoked, how much you smoke, and genetic factors, you may find it extremely difficult to quit smoking. It is a well known fact the genetic factors are at play and determine how susceptible someone is to a nicotine addiction, and for this reason some people need more than their will power to quit smoking. There are medical aids to quit smoking that help address the body’s dependence on nicotine, leaving you to concentrate your will power on other aspects of the addiction: namely, the social associations you likely have with smoking.\n\nFor many years the standard medical stop-smoking aid was the nicotine patch, which is attached to the skin and releases a steady supply of nicotine to the bloodstream. Fairly recently, though, another approach has become popular: the use of the drug Zyban (bupropion hydrochloride.)\n\nZyban’s development as an anti-smoking aid is a curious one: it was originally designed as an anti-depressant, and during clinical trials of the drug is was discovered that as a side effect, many smokers participating in the trails lost interest in cigarettes and found it very easy to quit. Further research revealed that the drug was an effective stop-smoking aid, and it was approved for use as such in 1997 by the FDA.\n\nZyban works in a completely different way from the nicotine patch. Instead of supplying nicotine to the bloodstream, Zyban alters brain chemistry in such a way that the desire for smoking is greatly reduced – many people find that cigarettes simply become unappealing after taking the drug. At no point does Zyban supply or regulate nicotine in the bloodstream.\n\nTo work effectively, Zyban is usually taken a few weeks before you actually stop smoking. Like all anti-depressants, it takes time for its effects to manifest. Once you’ve been taking the drug for some time, you stop smoking, and if all goes well you’ll find the process much easier than an unaided attempt.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind, however, that Zyban is a prescription drug that alters brain chemistry – in fact researchers are not even exactly sure how it works, only that it does for many people. Naturally, you doctor will be consulted in your decision to take Zyban, and it is crucial that Zyban is not taken in combination with other drugs. Make sure you talk to your doctor about the possible side effects of using Zyban to quit smoking: some common side effects include insomnia, dizziness, and dry mouth. In rarer cases, more serious side effects like seizures can occur. You must also discuss with your doctor the situations in which Zyban should not be taken, like if you are abruptly stopping the use of alcohol, or have a history of seizures.\n\nWhile Zyban should be approached with some caution, as long as it is properly discussed with your doctor, it can be a very effective aid in your battle to quit smoking."},{title:"Lasik Surgery Frequently Asked Questions",body:"What is Lasik Surgery?\n\nLasik, an acronym for Laser-assisted, is a form of refractive laser eye surgery procedure performed by ophthalmologists intended for correcting vision. The procedure is usually a preferred alternative to photorefractive keratectomy, PRK, as it requires less time for full recovery, and the patient experiences less pain overall.\n\nThe Lasik Operation\n\nThe Lasik Operation is performed with the patient awake and mobile; however, the patient typically is given a mild sedative and anesthetic eye drops.\n\nLasik is performed in two steps. The initial step is to create a flap of corneal tissue. This process is achieved with a mechanical microkeratome using a metal blade, or a femtosecond laser microkeratome that creates a series of tiny closely arranged bubbles within the cornea. A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back, revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea.\n\nThe second step of the procedure is to use an excimer laser to remodel the corneal stroma. The laser vaporizes tissue in a finely controlled manner without damaging adjacent stroma by releasing the molecular bonds that hold the cells together. No burning with heat or actual cutting is required to ablate the tissue. The layers of tissue removed are tens of micrometers thick.\n\nCurrently manufactured excimer lasers use a computer system that tracks the patient’s eye position up to 4,000 times per second, redirecting laser pulses for precise placement. After the laser has reshaped the cornea, the Lasik flap is repositioned over the treatment area by the surgeon. The flap remains in position by natural adhesion until healing is completed.\n\nPerforming the laser ablation in the deeper corneal stroma and under the Lasik flap fools the cornea into not knowing that it has had surgery. The wound response is muted, thus the patient is typically provided rapid visual recovery and virtually no pain.\n\nWavefront-guided Lasik\n\nWavefront-guided Lasik is a variation of Lasik surgery where, rather than apply a simple correction of focusing power to the cornea (as in traditional Lasik), an ophthalmologist applies a spatially varying correction, using a computer- controlled high-power UV laser guided by measurements from a wavefront sensor.\n\nThe goal is to achieve a more optically perfect eye, though the final result still depends on the physician’s success at predicting changes which occur during healing. Nor are wavefront aberrations the factor to degrade vision; especially in older patients, scattering from microscopic particles plays a major role. Hence, patients expecting so-called “super vision” from such procedures may be disappointed. Surgeons claim patients are generally more satisfied with this technique than with previous methods, particularly regarding lowered incidence of “halos”, the visual artifact caused by spherical aberration induced in the eye by earlier methods.\n\nAlthough there have been a number of improvements in Lasik technology, a large body of conclusive evidence on the chances of long-term complications is not yet in place. Also, there is a small chance of complications, such as slipped flap, corneal infection, haziness, halo, or glare. The procedure is irreversible.\n\nThe incidence of macular hole has been estimated at 0.2% to 0.3%.\n\nThe incidence of retinal detachment has been estimated at 0.36%.\n\nThe incidence of choroidal neovascularization has been estimated at 0.33%.\n\nThe incidence of uveitis has been estimated at 0.18%.\n\nAlthough the cornea usually is thinner after Lasik because of the removal of part of the stroma, refractive surgeons strive to maintain a minimum thickness in order to not structurally weaken the cornea.\n\nDecreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes has not been shown to be extremely dangerous to the eyes of Lasik patients. However, some mountain climbers have experienced a myopic shift at extreme altitudes. Although there are no published reports documenting diving-related complications after Lasik, urban legends that describe eyes that have popped open during scuba diving still persist.\n\nThere are also concerns about possible Lasik-related problems with night vision, to the extent that some armed forces around the world advise aspiring air force and special forces personnel not to have the surgery."},{title:"Insomnia Tips",body:"Insomnia is a very common complaint among older adults. The condition affects more than 70 million Americans. Some symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, difficulty with early morning awakening, or not feeling rested by a “good night’s sleep.” Occasionally, insomnia lasts for a short time and can be easily managed. Other times it is a chronic condition, lasting more than six months. This chronic insomnia is more troublesome and can affect work, social relationships, and health. Many people with insomnia are also diagnosed with other conditions such as depression, anxiety, allergies, or pain. Insomnia treatment begins with what is known as “sleep hygiene.” This includes regular sleep and wake times. You should avoid eating, drinking, or exercising before bedtime. The room should be cool, comfortable, and dark. \n\nPhilosophy of Sleep Hygiene\n\n1. keep a regular sleep schedule\n\n2. exercise regularly but avoid exercise before bed\n\n3. go to bed when sleepy\n\n4. do relaxing and enjoyable activities before bed\n\n5. keep the bedroom quiet and comfortable\n\n6. do not eat a large evening meal\n\n7. if you are not sleeping within 20 minutes, get up and return to bed when you are sleepy\n\n8. if you must take a nap, limit it to 30 minutes\n\n9. avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine\n\n10. have your pharmacist check your medications for stimulating drugs\n\nIf the “sleep hygiene” methods are not working, then it may me necessary to begin using medication. \n\nIf you are still having difficulty getting a good night’s sleep, you should talk to your pharmacist or doctor. The cause of your insomnia will need to be determined and you may need medication to help you sleep. Even if medication is used for insomnia, “sleep hygiene” principles should still be followed and can provide added benefit.\n\nThe best medication should act quickly and for a short period of time. This eliminates the “hangover effect” some people experience. \n\nThere are many other products that might be used for insomnia. Melatonin has been shown to be helpful in treating insomnia due to melatonin deficiency in elderly patients. It may also improve sleep quality but probably will not increase the length of sleep time. Kava kava and valerian root are also commonly used for the treatment of insomnia. Kava kava has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic insomnia. It is also known to be potentially dangerous to the liver. Valerian root may be helpful in helping one get to sleep as well as improving the quality of sleep. There are a number of treatment options available for the treatment and management of insomnia. It is important to diagnose and attempt to treat the root or underlying cause first. After that, the practice known as “sleep hygiene” should be practiced. If “sleep hygiene” is not effective, then the use of prescription medication may be warranted.\n\nThe cheapest treatment is, of course, “sleep hygiene.” If you try this approach and are unsuccessful, I would recommend over-the-counter diphenhydramine, while still practicing “sleep hygiene.” There are many different types available. The next step would be to visit your doctor for a prescription. As is my usual recommendation, begin with the lowest priced medication. \n\nFor insomnia treatment, I would recommend trazodone first. Trazodone represents approximately 40% of all insomnia prescriptions. It is very cheap at less than $10 a month. If that is ineffective, go with temazepam. It is also very popular and cheap. It is, however, a controlled substance which means there is a possibility of addiction."},{title:"Treat That Oral Thrush Now",body:"These days there are many kinds of diseases that are just dismissed by people as if they are not important. Discoloration, spots or rashes in any part of the bodies are deemed as irregularities but are not really candidates for urgent treatment. One such occurrence that can turn into diseases is oral thrush. Some people may not even know that what they or their loved ones have is oral thrush but oral thrush and all other kinds of thrush can spread to other parts of the body not originally affected if not treated.\n\nOral thrush is usually described as white to cream colored or yellow spots in certain areas of the mouth. These spots are also slightly raised so it can be felt as a small bump. People who have oral thrush normally feel no pain in the area underneath the spots and might even have the urge to scratch it off. If you scrape off the said spots, they leave small wounds that bleed slightly.\n\nThe earlier description is true in most cases but for adults, thrush can also cause an uncomfortable burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Some of the causes of thrush for adults include the simple of reason to stress or an even deeper problem that is an underlying disorder.\n\nOral thrush treatments for infants should include a period of waiting may be appropriate. It is highly advisable to go to the doctor. During the early stages, it is not really a life and death situation but start to worry when the condition does not resolve in two weeks in which case an oral thrust treatment from a doctor will come in handy. As for preventive oral thrush treatment or tips, it is a must to always sterilize bottle nipples or pacifiers and to wash, in hot and soapy water, toys that baby frequently chews on.\n\nOn the other hand oral thrush treatments for adults though largely similar to infants have some factors that are not really applicable to infants. The older victims of thrush are capable of trying to investigate for themselves the condition that caused the thrush and do something about it. They can actually do a sort of preventive oral thrush treatments or procedures to avoid the thrush from recurring. As soon as the condition that caused the oral thrush has been treated then the thrush itself can be cured.\n\nOral thrush treatment usually consists of anti-fungal medicines in the form of pastilles that are sucked or oral suspensions that are held in the mouth before swallowing. If unfortunately complications occur then oral thrush treatment that is systematic should be applied. This can be in the form of dosage of anti-fungal tablets or if advanced form of oral thrush treatment is needed then maybe through injection.\n\nAs in any disease, the important thing is early detection and being pro-active about the entire case at hand. There will always be that period of observation for cases like thrush but it should not last very long. The key really is to never ever hesitate to see your doctor for oral thrush treatment. Others may think that thrush is something that over the counter drugs can cure so there is no use to go to the doctor. Then again as mentioned, in the earlier paragraphs, the doctor has to see you to assess if what you have is a plain thrush or is a manifestation of something else.\n\nNote: This article may be freely reproduced as long as the AUTHOR’S resource box at the bottom of this article is included and and all links must be Active/Linkable with no syntax changes."},{title:"24×7 Medications Online Service",body:"With so many of diseases, medical science has been making constant efforts to provide medications so as to combat illnesses.

The Sopranos manages to address the biases and benefits of therapy and treatment while also combining clear-cut, unavoidable realities as to its effectiveness and the reasons why it seems to be everywhere.\n\nJust like on the show, therapy has long been thought of as untrustworthy, the refuge of the weak, practiced by money grabbing pseudo doctors who offer little more than an extensive and hard to comprehend vocabulary. As society finds that it is spending less and less time on the struggle for the basics necessary to life, however, the more therapy has become a part of our social fabric.\n\nTherapy is mow common practice for the individual as well as within relationships. The Sopranos is not the only show to find a huge market among those interested in the practice of therapy, as anyone who has seen the latest daytime television ratings can attest to. The Dr. Phil show has made a huge cultural impact on nothing more than one man’s practice of therapeutical processes. One of the main strengths of therapy is the fact that no matter how small the problem seems, it always helps to talk about it. It is true that disturbed individuals commonly benefit and are required to receive therapy and treatment, and in part this is the cause for much of the reason for the cultural vilification of the process. More and more people, however, are beginning to realize that going to therapy doesn’t mean they have the makings of a sociopath or a horrible marriage. It just gives them a chance to discuss area in their lives that they might be struggling with, and a qualified therapist is equipped to point the discussions in the right direction and offer solutions to immediate as well as potential problems.\n\nAs with any treatment, therapy needs to be approached with caution. Therapists who are not properly qualified can do much more damage to a person than they had before going in. Always take care to confirm a therapist’s credentials and record before signing up for sessions."},{title:"Eye Makeup After Lasik",body:"LASIK, or “laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis,” is the most common refractive surgery procedure. Refractive surgeries, including LASIK, reshape the cornea to correct distorted vision often eliminating the need for glasses or contacts.\n\nHigher-order aberrations are visual problems not captured in a traditional eye exam. In a young healthy eye, the level of higher-order aberrations are typically low and insignificant. Concern has long plagued the tendency of refractive surgeries to induce higher-order aberration not correctible by traditional contacts or glasses. The advancement of lasik technique and technologies has helped eliminate the risk of clinically significant visual impairment after the surgery.\n\nThe following are some of the more frequently reported complications of LASIK:\n\n1. Dry eyes\n\n2. Overcorrection or undercorrection\n\n3. Visual acuity fluctuation\n\n4. Halos or starbursts around light sources at night\n\n5. Light sensitivity\n\n6. Ghosts or double vision\n\n7. Wrinkles in flap (striae)\n\n8. Decentered ablation\n\nHow Soon Can I Use Eye Makeup?\n\nYou may resume wearing eye makeup starting 1-2 weeks after your treatment. We strongly recommend that you purchase new eye makeup, specifically mascara, to avoid potential infection following your treatment.\n\nThe most important thing for anyone considering LASIK surgery is to determine if they are a good candidate. Finding a surgeon who will honestly assess compatibility is extremely important, and vastly preferable to a provider who does not do a careful examination, and thus risks serious side effects.\n\nLASIK is an outpatient surgical procedure and will take 10 to 15 minutes for each eye.\n\nThe only anesthetic used is an eye drop that numbs the surface of the eye. The procedure is done with the person awake. LASIK may be done on one or both eyes during the same session.\n\nDuring LASIK, a special knife (a microkeratome) is used to cut a hinged flap of corneal tissue off the outer layer of the eyeball. The flap is lifted out of the way and a special laser is used to reshape the underlying corneal tissue."},{title:"Two Questions To Ask About Bird Flu Vaccines",body:"The results of a government-funded study show that very high doses of an avian influenza vaccine, supplied by Sanofi-Aventis, are needed to produce an immune response that should guard against the virus. 54% of the volunteers received two shots of 90 micrograms each, 28 days apart. A typical flu shot is 15 micrograms. Based on the requirements seen in the study, the U.S. government’s current stockpile of vaccines would provide enough for only about four million people, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe problem isn’t just a matter of dosage. It is also a matter of production. Flu vaccines are produced using hen’s eggs,a 50-year old technology, if it can be called that. Automated machines inject hundreds of thousands of eggs, then an 11-day waiting period begins while the eggs incubate, brewing viruses that are then killed and bottled. To produce millions of the the final product takes about six months.\n\nThen there’s the question no one seems to be asking: if we plan to rely upon chicken eggs to incubate an H5N1 virus, how do we know the H5N1 virus won’t kill the eggs? H5N1 already kills chickens. Shouldn’t we assume it also kills a high percentage of chicken eggs? Sanofi-Aventis is spending $150 million of its own money building a new vaccine-making plant based on the theory that H5N1 won’t kill the eggs. By the way, eggs have to be ordered many months in advance for this antiquated process.\n\nAnd where does Sanofi-Aventis plan to get all these egg-laying chickens anyway? Millions of chickens have been slaughtered worldwide already and a pre-pandemic scenario could kill off whole U.S. chicken farms at once.\n\nHowever, there is a new vaccine technology on the horizon. It’s called cell-based vaccine. Giant vats of living cells, such as dog kidney cells, multiply and then are inoculated with the virus. There are two companies already in the marketplace, one in Holland, one in Germany, but the technology won’t be widely available for years. The FDA must review the entire method before any equipment can be imported to the U.S.\n\nClearly, the U.S. has waited for a new virus to come along to spur vaccine research. We may have waited too long. H5N1 isn’t waiting. It’s figuring out how to mutate into human-to-human transmission. In fact, the rate of mutation is alarming. Dr. Robert Webster, Ph.D., Member, St. Jude Faculty Rose Marie Thomas Chair, calls H5N1 “the most frightening virus I’ve ever seen in 40 years of research.”\n\nIf you and your family are counting on a vaccine to protect you against H5N1 (Avian Influenza), don’t bet on it. There are still too many unanswered questions and too many risks."},{title:"Learn About Swimmers Ear",body:"It is an infection which affects the outer ear canal. The technical term for swimmers ear is known as otitis externa. It is a very common problem among children. As it mainly affects swimmers it is known as the swimmers ear. But it is not only restricted to swimmers. People having bath or are in shower may also be get affected by this infection.\n\nIt is caused when water gets accumulated in the ear canal and leads to an infection. This infection causes swelling, redness, heat and pain. Infection leads to formation of pus which oozes out from the ear. There can be itchiness so any slight movement or touching of the ear can cause lot of pain. The infection is induced due to a germ called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is commonly found in soil and water.\n\nPolluted water is the major cause of this trouble. Swimming in polluted lakes and rivers can be very hazardous. If your children are swimming in an enclosed pool environment you still cannot be sure about the cleanliness of the water. Even when water is chlorinated you may not escape the bacteria.\n\nBacteria grows when the water get accumulated in the ear canal. It washes away the protective earwax coating leading to an infection. The moistness of the ear may lead to vulnerability of ear and become prone to an infection. Fungal infection and constant diving are some of the causes for this infection.\n\nOnce detected you should avoid getting into the water. Allow time to heal your wounds before you jump back in. Wear shower caps when in shower to restrict water from getting into your ears. You can wear ear plugs or cotton balls to prevent water from entering your ears. Avoid fidgeting your ears with cotton swabs or any pointed objects.\n\nYour doctor will treat this problem by prescribing some ear drops. Due to the immense pain he may even prescribe pain killers. These antibiotics drops may help to clear the problem. By taking some precautionary measures you can avoid this problem too. Always keep your ears dry. If any amount of water gets into your ears remove by using an alcohol-based product. Avoid swimming in polluted areas.\n\nThere are some common symptoms which can help you detect swimmers ear. Your ear becomes very sensitive and gives you the feeling of being choked. You may suffer from fever and hearing gets deteriorated. The pain in the ear may spread through the neck, face or part of your face.\n\nHome Remedies\n\nThe mixture of alcohol and white vinegar should be used in 1:1 proportion. A few drops of this mixture would evaporate all the moisture from your ear.\n\nUse a hairdryer by keeping it in the warm setting using it over your ear to dry it.\n\nWarning: The reader of this article should exercise all precautionary measures while following instructions on the home remedies from this article. Avoid using any of these products if you are allergic to it. The responsibility lies with the reader and not with the site or the writer."},{title:"Cellulite Treatment Options",body:"Cellulite is fat that is caught between bands of connective tissue directly beneath the skin that creates a lumpy, bumpy orange peel appearance mostly on the hips, thighs and backsides of most women. While not life threatening, it is ugly, unsightly and embarrassing if you’re the one that has it.\n\nBecause cellulite is primarily caused by fat, reducing the body’s fat content by creating a caloric deficit either by eating less or exercising is the first step for reducing cellulite. However, diet and exercise do not always give women (and some men) the results that they’re looking for. This is where treatment options come in.\n\nCellulite is located right beneath the skin which is why many treatment options involve -treating the fat, -relaxing the bands of connective tissue and -proper skincare. Treating the fat involves both aerobic and anaerobic (muscle conditioning) exercises and proper diet with some caloric restrictions as mentioned above.\n\nThere are two treatments that are purported to minimize cellulite by relaxing the bands of connective tissue that “hold” the fat. One is called Endermologie and the other is called VelaSmooth. Endermologie is usually performed in a plastic surgeon or cosmetic dermatologist’s office. It uses a motorized device that that has 2 adjustable rollers with suction that creates smooth and regulated deep tissue mobilization. In order for it to be effective, the client must have several consecutive treatments and then follow up treatments for maintenance. The results are often visible somewhat quickly but are temporary if maintenance isn’t done.\n\nVelaSmooth is the newest technology in the realm of cellulite treatments. It uses both infrared red light and radio frequency waves to relax the bands of connective tissue that trap fat and make it appear bumpy. It’s non-invasive and must be done twice a week for 5 weeks and then monthly. The initial results of VelaSmooth are very promising.\n\nProper skincare in the cellulite prone areas can reduce it’s appearance. There are a number of cellulite creams, gels and lotions that work temporarily to varying degrees. It’s important to use these topical treatments as directed. It’s also important to make sure that the cream or gel is massaged in well in order to stimulate circulation. Some of these products work better than others so it’s a matter of trial and error as well as persistence for topical treatments to work effectively."},{title:"What Is Classical Homeopathy",body:"Classical homeopathy is generally defined as a system of medical treatment based on the use of minute quantities of remedies that in larger doses produce effects similar to those of the disease being treated. It is believed that very small doses of a medication could have very powerful healing effects because their potency could be affected by vigorous and methodical shaking. This is referred to this alleged increase in potency by vigorous shaking as dynamization. It is also thought succussion could release immaterial and spiritual powers, thereby making substances more active. Tapping on a leather pad or the heel of the hand was alleged to double the dilution.\n\nExamples include: the use of an isopathic (disease associated) agent as a first prescription in a stuck case, when the beginning of disease coincides with a specific event such as vaccination; the use of a chemically related substance when a remedy fails yet seems well-indicated; and more recently, the use of substances based on their natural classification (the periodic table or biological taxonomy). This last approach is considered to be promising by some in the homeopathic community, because it allows for grouping remedies and classifying the ever-burgeoning Materia Medica, but is rejected by many purists because it involves speculation about remedy action without proper provings.\n\nThere are estimated to be more than 100,000 physicians practicing homeopathy worldwide, with an estimated 500 million people receiving treatment. More than 12,000 medical doctors and licensed health care practitioners administer homeopathic treatment in the UK, France, and Germany. Since 2001, homeopathy is regulated in the European Union by Directive 2001/83/EC; the latest amendments make it compulsory for member states to implement a simple registration procedure for homeopathic remedies.\n\nIn the UK, homeopathic remedies may be sold over the counter. The UK has five homeopathic hospitals where treatment, funded by the National Health Service, is available and many regional clinics. Homeopathy is not practiced by most of the medical profession, but there is a core of public support, including from the Prince of Wales."

Owing much to the technological advances, several new refractive surgery procedures have been developed. However, the procedure is still the most potent and prevalent treatment of all surgical interventions for the eye.\n\nThe prevalence of LASIK has also ensured that it is very much accessible to nearly everyone who desires to undergo the surgery. Therefore, finding an efficient eye surgeon in your vicinity won’t be difficult at all. LASIK procedure can surely eliminate your vision problems and offer you crystal clear vision – something that every living soul desires.\n\nIn essence, the procedure makes use of a high-precision laser called the excimer laser, which is an ultraviolet chemical laser. The procedure involves cutting a flap in the cornea. The flap is folded back to make room for making incisions in the corneal tissue. Highly sophisticated computer-controlled equipment is used to perform the surgery. For instance, a sensor is used to measure the eye position around 4000 times per second. The laser is redirected to make precise incisions in order to reshape the cornea so as to ensure accurate refraction. This results in enhanced visual acuity.\n\nLASIK is a reliable and rather safe procedure relative to other refractive surgery procedures. It is not that time-consuming either. Patients witness speedy recovery after the procedure. Most patients have a significant improvement in vision just after the procedure. Some patients may experience blurred vision, but this condition is alleviated within a week or two when the cornea is completely healed.\n\nAnother reason why this procedure is the preferred refractive surgery is because it has a minimal complication rate of 5%. Such a meager complication rate speaks volumes for the efficacy of LASIK. When you choose LASIK, you choose the best that technology has to offer. Therefore, you can easily rely on LASIK and need not be anxious about it."},{title:"Natural Treatments For High Blood Pressure",body:"High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a serious condition and is often dubbed the “silent killer” because it can do so much damage to your body before you even know you have it.\n\nHigh blood pressure can cause heart failure, stroke and even death in the most serious cases. And, did you know that some of the medications your doctor may prescribe could do almost as much damage as the high blood pressure itself? Such medications can have rather serious side effects including dizziness, nausea, stomach problems, loss of appetite, fatigue, impotence and insomnia.\n\nHerbs for Hypertension\n\nThere are a number of scientific studies that indicate that a natural approach or treatment for your high blood pressure could be an effective alternative. There are many different herbs that are used to treat hypertension, including the following:\n\nHawthorn, also known as Crataegus Oxyacantha, is a well-known heart tonic and is one of the best safe herbal supplements to help treat hypertension. By dilating the blood vessels Hawthorn can provide your heart with the level of energy it needs to pump your blood. Hawthorn is full of anti-oxidants, which can keep plaque from building up on the arterial walls and reduce the risk of a heart attack. It works only it it’s taken consistently for a long period of time.\n\nYou can find hawthorn in herbal formulas designed to treat high blood pressure. Also, you can make a tea with this herb by adding two teaspoons of crushed leaves and berries to a cup of boiling water. Let it steep for approximately twenty minutes, then strain and drink. You may drink up to two cups of this tea per day.\n\nAnother highly studied herb that is used to treat hypertension is Passiflora Incarnata. This herb contains different natural chemicals that help to calm the entire body, relax the blood vessels and help reduce overall blood pressure. To make a tea using passion flower mix a teaspoon of dried leaves with a cup of boiling water and let it steep for about fifteen minutes. Strain and drink before going to bed.\n\nViburnum Opulus, also known as Guelder Rose bark is considered a cardiac tonic. It helps to relax the body and get rid of the tension that usually is associated with high blood pressure."},{title:"The Risks Of Lasik Surgery",body:"The 21st century is the golden age for surgical procedures, among them an increasingly popular method of corrective eye surgery known as LASIK. LASIK is an acronym for the surgery, which stands for Laser Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis. This procedure has become increasingly reliable, with unresolved complications reported in only 3 to 6 percent of patients. The risk of complications is still there, however, and can take several different forms.\n\nThe complications of LASIK surgery can include the following: Dry eyes, over or under correction, visual acuity fluctuation, halos or starbursts around light sources at night, light sensitivity, double vision, wrinkles in the flap, striation, decentered ablation, debris or growth under the flap, induced astigmatism. These complications are classified according to whether they arise in the preoperative procedures, the procedure itself, or after the operation either early on or later.\n\nEach of the complications is unique unto itself, and it is important to remember that LASIK surgery is irreversible should nay of the complications occur. May of the complications such as halos and ghosts are not tested by standard eye tests, and need to be accounted for separately.\n\nOver and under correction are the result of the surgeon incorrectly estimating the concentration that needs to be applied during the surgery. Many risks of LASIK surgery can also be increased by phenomena that may not have occurred to the patient, such as racial origin and environmental occurrences.\n\nImproperly formed flaps can lead to an irregular surface and vision defects as the flap fails to properly adhere to the surface of the eye. This condition can be corrected with further surgery, although the costs will usually continue to accrue and sometimes a decrease in visual acuity. A flap that is too thick can also weaken the eye’s surface and result in bulging. Some patients have a condition that already makes them conducive to bulging, and thus are rejected as candidates for LASIK surgery.\n\nAs LASIK surgery become more an more commonplace, the risks and recovery times are becoming less common and pronounced. As with nay surgery, and especially those with cosmetic implications, LASIK is becoming increasingly popular. As people sense the money to be made in practicing the procedure, the risk of employing a surgeon who is not versed or experienced enough in the procedure also increases. Make sure to discuss LASIK surgery with your ophthalmologist before undergoing the procedure, to determine if you are eligible and also to suggest a list of surgeons who practice the procedure in your area. Make sure to contact other patients that have undergone the surgery by the particular surgeon you are thinking about employing in order to gain some first hand knowledge about her practice and success rate. Also look into where the surgeon was educated and if she served under another surgeon before going out to do the procedure on her own. There is no such thing as being too careful when it comes to surgical procedures, and treatment for your eyes are no exception."},{title:"5 Tips To Finding Effective Anti Snore Devices",body:"If you have tried everything, but still seem to suffer from snoring, don’t give up. Before turning to surgery, consider shopping for anti-snore devices. These products do not typically require a prescription, are economically priced and may just be the answer that you are looking for. However, as is the case when shopping for anything, there are a lot of anti-snore devices out there and knowing what to look for will make your selection process a lot easier.\n\nTip 1\n\nRead the packaging, or information, carefully.

By selecting a product that is backed by a company guarantee, you can feel good in knowing that you are getting value for your dollar.\n\nThis article is intended for informational purposes only. It should not be used as, or in place of, professional medical advice. Before beginning any treatment for snoring, please consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and remedy."},{title:"Joint Pain",body:"Joints are the areas where two or more bones meet. Most joints are mobile, allowing the bones to move. Joints consist of the following:      Cartilage – at the joint, the bones are covered with cartilage (a connective tissue), which is made up of cells and fibers and is wear-resistant. Cartilage helps reduce the friction of movement.    Synovial membrane – a tissue called the synovial membrane lines the joint and seals it into a joint capsule. The synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid (a clear, sticky fluid) around the joint to lubricate it.    Ligaments – strong ligaments (tough, elastic bands of connective tissue) surround the joint to give support and limit the joint’s movement.    Tendons – tendons (another type of tough connective tissue) on each side of a joint attach to muscles that control movement of the joint.    Bursas – fluid-filled sacs, called bursas, between bones, ligaments, or other adjacent structures help cushion the friction in a joint.    Synovial fluid – a clear, sticky fluid secreted by the synovial membrane.   Joint Pain Associated with Arthritis\n\nArthritis Joint Pain (http://www.arthritis-joint-pain.info/) – The word arthritis literally means joint inflammation, but it is often used to refer to a group of more than 100 rheumatic diseases that can cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. These diseases may affect not only the joints but also other parts of the body, including important supporting structures such as muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments. Two of the most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (http://www.synotrex.com/rheumatoid-arthritis.html).\n\nMost forms of arthritis are associated with joint pain that can be divided into two general categories: acute and chronic. Acute pain is temporary, lasting a few seconds or longer. Chronic pain, such as that seen in people with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, ranges from mild to severe and can last weeks, months, and years to a lifetime. More than 40 million Americans are affected by some form of arthritis, and many have chronic joint pain that limits daily activity. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, affecting over 20 million Americans, while rheumatoid arthritis, which affects about 2.1 million Americans, is the most disabling form of the disease.\n\nWhat Causes Joint Pain?\n\nThe joint pain (http://www.synotrex.com/) associated with arthritis may come from different sources. These may include inflammation of the synovial membrane (tissue that lines the joints), the tendons, or the ligaments; muscle strain; and fatigue. A combination of these factors contributes to the intensity of the joint pain.\n\nArthritic joint pain varies greatly from person to person. Factors that contribute to the joint pain include swelling within the joint, the amount of heat or redness present, or damage that has occurred within the joint. In addition, activities affect joint pain differently so that some patients note joint pain after first getting out of bed in the morning, whereas others develop joint pain after prolonged use of the joint. Find detailed information on Joints and Joint Pain Products (http://www.synotrex.com/joint-pain-products.html).\n\nCARTILAGE\n\nWhat is Cartilage?\n\nCartilage is the key to healthy joints. Cartilage is the spongy tissue that cushions the ends of the bones within the joints. Although cartilage is composed of 65 to 80 percent water, there are three other important components that make up the rest of cartilage tissue: collagen, proteoglycans, and chondrocytes.      Collagen: a fibrous protein. Collagen is also the building block of skin, tendon, bone, and other connective tissues.    Proteoglycans: a combination of proteins and sugars. Strands of proteoglycans and collagen weave together and form a mesh-like tissue. This allows cartilage to flex and absorb physical shock.    Chondrocytes: cells that are found all through the cartilage. They mainly help cartilage stay healthy and grow. Sometimes, however, they release substances called enzymes that destroy collagen and other proteins. Researchers are trying to learn more about chondrocytes."},{title:"Remedies For Colic",body:"Any parent will tell you that colic is one of the most excruciating experiences of early parenthood. The baby cries as if in dire pain, and there just seems to be nothing for a parent to do. A baby is suspected to have colic if, around the age of three weeks, the baby starts crying inconsolably for hours at a time. The condition is termed ‘colic’ because it was assumed that babies were crying due to stomach pain. Doctors are no longer sure that a stomach ache causes colic, but the term continues to be in use. The first step is to ascertain the cause of distress. Newborn babies often cry because of hunger, earache, wetness or cold. If these factors can be safely ruled out, crying can be attributed to the mysterious colic. Sometimes little tummies do not agree with the protein in traditional baby formula or from a mother’s milk. After consulting your doctor, change the formula. Switch to a soy-based formula. Even in breastfed babies, an excess of cows’ milk products in the mother’s diet can cause tummy aches. Root vegetables and highly acidic food products like chocolates, tomatoes, or grapefruit in the mother’s diet can also upset the stomach of a feeding infant. Gas producing food like broccoli, cabbage, onions, cauliflower, peppers, and citrus fruits may all become suspect at such a time. Your doctor may advise you to go on an exclusion diet for some time. Most newborns outgrow their sensitivity to food and become naturally vigorous and robust within three to six months. If the baby is being breastfed, it is necessary to feed on demand. The evening hours see a decline in production of milk. Feeding the baby often during these hours will ensure an abundant supply of milk. If the baby is being bottle-fed, care must be taken to hold the bottle properly, so that there is no swallowing of air. Patting the baby gently on the back after each feeding is another effective method of releasing gas. With the increasing incidences of cot deaths, doctors advise parents to put their babies to sleep on their back. However sometimes babies with colic like to lie on their stomachs. This is safe, so long as you are awake and vigilant. Doctors sometimes attribute colic to maternal stress. It’s only natural for mothers to get stressed when little babies cry until they are red in the face. But babies are very sensitive to stress and a mother whose nerves are frayed cannot calm a distressed baby. At such a time, mothers should get extra help and spend some time away from the scene. Take a warm bath or go for a stroll. Traditionally, colicky babies have been fed with gripe water approximately half an hour before feeding. But these products should be checked for their ingredients. Some may contain artificial ingredients and preservatives. Sensitive digestive systems of colicky infants can definitely do without such irritants. A warm aromatherapy bath calms and soothes the baby. Add a few drops of lavender to warm bath water and gently massage the tummy. This will help relieve painfully trapped gas. Babies also like to be in water. Small babies need a lot of warmth and security. Swaddling the baby in warm clothes and holding it against the steady soothing rhythm of a parent’s heartbeat can sometimes soothe the baby’s pain. Walking, rocking, and repetitive movements also have a calming effect. Applying gentle pressure on the abdomen will help relieve stomach ache. This position is known as the ‘colic hold.’ Finally, remember colic is a stage in the growth of your baby.

More than 1 million patients undergo the LASIK procedure in the United States each year.\n\nMost patients notice an improvement in their vision immediately upon completion of their surgery. By the next day, vision is often dramatically improved. However, patients should understand that while fast visual recovery characterizes the operation, it can take several months before some patients achieve their final vision after LASIK. Several studies demonstrate that the vision of a number of patients continued to improve up to six months post-operatively. During that time, patients may experience slight fluctuations in vision throughout the day. These symptoms generally diminish with time.\n\nFor some patients, vision after LASIK matches the sharpness of vision they had with glasses or contact lenses before the procedure. However, an estimated 1.5 million LASIK patients still face a return to glasses as their near vision begins to diminish with age. Fortunately, there’s another procedure-recently approved by the FDA-to help treat presbyopia, the common condition known as “aging eyes.”\n\nNearVision CK (conductive keratoplasty) is currently being used by refractive surgeons to improve near vision in presbyopic patients, and is also being studied for its effectiveness in patients with a history of LASIK vision correction to treat nearsightedness (myopia). The preliminary clinical data holds promise for the millions of successful LASIK patients who aren’t interested in renewing their dependence on corrective lenses.\n\nBoasting one of the highest safety profiles in the refractive market, NearVision CK uses gentle radio waves instead of a laser or scalpel, bringing near vision back into focus without cutting or removing of tissue-all during a painless procedure that takes just minutes to perform. Most post-LASIK NearVision CK trial patients recount dramatic changes in their ability to perform everyday tasks without glasses, including:\n\n• 95 percent of patients were able to read a computer screen, compared to only 67 percent prior to the NearVision treatment; and\n\n• Only 29 percent of patients were able to read menus or golf scorecards without glasses, but more than 86 percent were able to do so post-NearVision CK."},{title:"Survey Shows Two Thirds Of Migraine Sufferers Dissatisfied",body:"If you haven’t found relief for migraine, you’re not alone. About 28 million people suffer from the severe, throbbing pain of migraine, which can last from hours to days, keeping sufferers from family, work and daily life. Yet, two-thirds of patients say they are less than satisfied with their current treatment, according to a survey of 3,064 migraine sufferers conducted by Pfizer. Sufferers may often feel discouraged and unmotivated to discuss the pain and impact with others, even their doctors. To help sufferers overcome barriers that can prevent them from seeking effective pain relief, life coach and migraine sufferer Rhonda Britten is speaking out as part of a new education campaign sponsored by Pfizer.\n\n“The impact of migraine on a person’s life can be tremendous,” said Britten, star of the reality show “Starting Over.” “But many are living with pain because they have become too frustrated to do anything more to help themselves.” Applying problem-solving techniques that she developed through her Fearless Living Institute, Britten has created a series of exercises to motivate sufferers to talk with their physicians. Specifically, the tools take sufferers though a step-by-step process to help them assess the impact of migraine on their daily lives, identify why they have not taken action to find adequate pain relief, and ultimately have more productive discussions with their doctors. The tools are available in a free brochure called “Be Stronger Than Your Migraine,” by calling (866) 519-0300.\n\nDr. Dion Graybeal, assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, agrees that too many migraine patients suffer needlessly.\n\n“Patients must play an active role in seeking out the care they need,” Graybeal said. “Even sufferers who feel like they have ‘tried everything’ may not be aware of all the treatment options available to them. Patients need to feel comfortable talking to their doctor to find what is right for them.”\n\nVanessa Simmons, 27, has had migraine since high school. “I assumed that all treatments worked the same so I didn’t go back to my doctor to tell her that I wasn’t getting relief,” she said. “Thankfully, I finally opened up about the impact migraine continued to have on my life and worked with my doctor to identify the right treatment for me.”\n\nThe new brochure is part of the free tool kit developed by Pfizer, “Understanding in a Box,” that also includes tips for family and friends, information about effective treatment, and the children’s book “Mama Lion’s Migraine.”"},{title:"Dangerous Drugs In The News",body:"A number of “dangerous drugs” have been in the news recently. These reports started to surface when Congress was having hearings about the painkiller, Vioxx. A Food and Drug Administration staff member testified in front of Congress that there are safety concerns about several medications. These medications are Accutane, Arava, Bextra, Celebrex, Crestor, Lotronex, Meridia, and Serevent.   When you put the problems in perspective, the number of problems related to these medications is incredibly small compared to the number of people who took the drugs. If five million people have taken the medication and one has had a serious side effect, that’s one in a five million, or 0.00002%. The chances are not that great, but the chance is there.\n\nThe following is a quick summary of what the FDA believes are some of the concerns with these medications.\n\nAccutane\n\nThis medication is very effective for severe acne. It is also well-known that Accutane causes serious birth defects. Because of this, the manufacturer has set guidelines for its dispensing. If the patient is female, she must have a negative pregnancy test EVERY month before the doctor writes the prescription. It then must be filled within seven days. The patient must also go back to the doctor every month for a new prescription. Women who take Accutane and are sexually active should two forms of birth control and not become pregnant for at least a month after stopping the medication.\n\nThe problems arise when women take Accutane from a friend or get it from another country. They are then not being monitored by a doctor and may not know the dangers of pregnancy.\n\nAnother topic surrounding Accutane is the reported increase in suicide rates. It has been stated that Accutane makes some patients feel depressed or irritable. This is where friends and family can step in and discuss these problems with the patient. If someone is feeling depressed or has thoughts of suicide while on Accutane, please tell them to let their doctor know right away.\n\nArava\n\nArava is used for treating severe rheumatoid arthritis. During the last several years, reports of serious lung or liver problems have arisen in patients taking this medication. Patients on Arava are required to get frequent liver function tests to detect any problems before they get serious. Virtually every time, liver failure occurs gradually over a long period of time. By testing frequently, these problems can be detected early and can be fixed. The signs of liver problems include: nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, dark urine, pale stools, and yellowish eyes or skin.\n\nThe signs of lung problems include fever above 101      "

And, it is thanks to these sleep apnea remedies that you will never have to lose another night’s sleep.\n\nOne of the first sleep apnea remedies to try would include simple steps that you can take, on your own, to help treat the disorder. If you sleep on your back regularly, stop now. Try sleeping on your side instead. This may help to prevent your airways from being blocked, which is what tends to happen when apnea sufferers sleep on their back. If you suffer from allergies, rid your home of any/all allergens, including pet hair, cigarette smoke and dust. Regular cleaning and the use of air filtration units in each room will go a long way in helping you to breathe cleaner air. Obesity is a major concern that often leads to sleep apnea. Therefore, one of the best sleep apnea remedies is to simply begin a healthy, well-balanced program consisting of diet and exercise. If you are overweight, or have recently been diagnosed with obesity, losing weight will help to curb sleep apnea as well as possibly prevent other health problems in the future. While you are altering your lifestyle, it is time to give up alcohol and cigarettes if either of these are present because both may lead to sleep apnea.\n\nAfter all natural sleep apnea remedies have been exhausted, a physician may recommend the use of a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device. This machine provides the apnea sufferer with a continual amount of pressurized air, which will prevent the muscles and tissue in the throat from collapsing during sleep. With sleep apnea, the sufferer actually stops breathing through the night due to this collapse, which is why the use of this machine is often a very vital treatment among the sleep apnea remedies. The Sleep Genie, which is a doctor approved anti-snoring device, comfortably supports the jaw while helping to keep the mouth closed during sleep. While not intended to cure sleep apnea, the Sleep Genie often helps users to have a better quality sleep. Users of the CPAP machine need to sleep with their mouth closed in order to prevent the benefits of the machine from escaping through the night. Some users of the CPAP machine have found a good companion in the Sleep Genie, which will secure their closed mouth during the night.\n\nThis article is intended for informational purposes only.

The post-operative complication rate is estimated from 3% to 6%. LASIK eye surgery involves cutting a flap of the corneal tissue with a hinge being left at one end of the flap. The flap is then folded back to reveal the stroma, the middle section of the cornea. After reshaping the corneal tissue with the aid of a high precision laser, typically the excimer laser, the flap is repositioned so as to remain in place by natural adhesion until it heals completely.\n\nThe LASIK procedure entails certain flap complications. Among the post-operative flap complications, a slipped flap is one of the most common. The corneal flap created during the operation may inadvertently detach from the rest of the cornea. It is imperative that the patient goes home and sleeps after surgery so as to let the flap heal, since the chances of flap dislocation are the greatest immediately after the surgery.\n\nOther types of flap complications include folds in flaps and undesired epithelial in-growth. Post-operative folds in flap typically necessitate repositioning of the flap. Flap related problems are relatively common when it comes to LASIK complications. But they rarely lead to a permanent visual acuity loss. Moreover, the occurrence of flap complications decreases with increased surgeon experience. An expert LASIK surgeon, wielding superlative equipment, is far less likely to commit an error during the surgery.\n\nSince LASIK entails the removal of a part of the corneal tissue, the cornea becomes thinner as a result of the procedure. Myopic shifts at extreme altitudes have been attributable to this thinning of the corneal surface. LASIK technology has advanced in leaps and bounds, with much advanced and risk free procedures available today. Owing to this, the chances of flap complications are rather minuscule. Moreover, there isn’t a large body of conclusive evidence so as to assert the chances of any long-term flap complications due to LASIK.\n\nIn summary, LASIK is a viable and safe procedure when it comes to correcting a variety of refractive errors. Furthermore, whatever small flap complications may arise can be rectified with ease.\n\nFinding a LASIK surgery that you are confident about will be able to give you more information about the risks of laser eye surgery."},{title:"Croup An Infection Affecting The Young",body:"Croup is an inflammation of the larynx, trachea and bronchi. It affects the voice box due to an infection of the vocal cord. In adults this disease is known as laryngitis. It obstructs the breathing which makes this disease severe.

While it is true that LASIK is a type of laser eye surgery, there are a number of other laser procedures that can produce equally successful results for individuals suffering from myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. In fact, there are actually four different types of laser eye surgery: PRK, LASIK, Customized LASIK, and LASEK.\n\nPRK, or photorefractive keratectomy, makes use of a specialized cool laser beam, called an excimer laser, to remove excess corneal tissue. The removal of this tissue corrects the shape of the eye so that light entering the eye can be properly focused on the retina. The outer surface layer called the epithelium, is removed to expose the underlying corneal tissue. Once this tissue is revealed, the excimer laser is used to reshape the cornea. The main distinction between PRK and LASIK is that PRK does not make use of a corneal flap. Instead, the epithelium is allowed to gradually heal through the body’s natural healing process. To protect the exposed cornea, surgeons fit patients with a lightweight contact lens to serve as a bandage for the eye. The contact lens also reduces discomfort. The lens is usually only worn for a few days, two to three days post-operative, at which time the eye is allowed to heal as normal with no bandage. LASIK is the most widely known and performed type of laser eye surgery in the United States. LASIK stands for Laser Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis, which literally means to “reshape the cornea from within using a laser.” LASIK differs from PRK in that a small flap is made in the stroma of the eye. This flap, made by either a microkeratome or IntraLase, is then peeled back to expose the underlying corneal tissue. An excimer laser is then used to reshape the cornea to correct any refractive errors. Once the cornea has been reshaped, the cornea flap is put back into place and smoothed out. The flap acts as a natural bandage to help the eye heal and protect the delicate cornea. The benefit of LASIK is that the use of the flap helps the cornea heals more quickly than it would using the PRK technique, and reduces much of the discomfort felt during the healing process. Many ophthalmologic surgeons are now offered the next evolution in LASIK surgery, which they called Customized LASIK. The general procedure used to correct refractive errors is the same as is used for traditional LASIK procedures, with the addition of wavefront devices used to map the unique surface of the patient’s eye. The wavefront device passes a narrow ray of light through the systems and into the eye, measuring any optical distortions that result as the light exits back out the eye. Any irregularities identified are then fed back into the system so that the laser can automatically correct for aberrations on the surface of the eye. Proponents of Customized LASIK claim that the use of wavefront technology enables surgeons to treat higher order aberrations that can contribute to low-light visual disturbances such as halos and glare not corrected by traditional LASIK, eyeglasses, or contact lenses. Customized LASIK can provide patients who suffer from higher order aberrations with an increase in visual clarity.\n\nThe final type of laser eye surgery is LASEK, or Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelial Keratectomy. LASEK is especially helpful for patients who have a thin or flat cornea, making them questionable candidates for LASIK and Customized LASIK procedures. During LASEK, a small trephine blade is used to cut into the outer skin of the eye, called the epithelium. Once the cut has been made, the eye is bathed in a mild alcohol solution to allow the edges of the epithelium to soften. This permits the surgeon to gently tease the epithelium flap out of the way to expose the underlying tissue. An excimer layer reshapes the eye under the flap to correct any refractive errors, after which the flap is replaced over the treated cornea. As with LASIK, the replacement of the flap in LASEK speeds up the natural healing process and serves to minimize discomfort resulting from the procedure. Although the end result of PRK, LASIK, Customized LASIK, and LASEK is the same – the reduction of refractive errors – the method by which these corrections are made differ. Each procedure has its advantages and disadvantages and is best suited for certain types of patients. Individuals who are considering laser eye surgery to correct their vision and reduce dependency on corrective lenses are urged to contact their ophthalmologist to inquire about available options and learn if they are a strong candidate for one of more of these procedures."},{title:"Apricot Kernel Oil",body:"World over people use massage therapy to help promote healthy skin, nourish and strengthen the body, relieve stress, reduce pain, and encourage balance and well being.

While in the past open surgery was the only option available for most patients diagnosed with hernia, nowadays the surgical treatment for hernia is a lot simpler and involves fewer risks. Thanks to the modern medical equipment available these days, the surgical treatment for hernia is safer and involves a shorter period of post-operative hospitalization. Until recently, open surgery was a very common form of medical treatment for hernia. This type of surgery involves wide abdominal incisions, exposing the patients to a high risk of developing complications (internal bleeding, post-operative infections). In addition, patients who suffer traditional surgery recover slowly and require up to a few weeks of hospitalization. From an esthetical point of view, traditional surgery also leaves patients with pronounced, slow-healing abdominal scars. Due to these undesirable effects of “open surgery”, most medical professionals have recently replaced it with modern, more reliable surgical procedures, such as the “Minimal-Repair Technique”.\n\nThe “Minimal-Repair Technique” is a revolutionary surgical procedure in the treatment for hernia. Initially intended for correcting inguinal hernia, the “Minimal-Repair Technique” can nowadays be performed in the treatment of various other forms of hernia. This new approach in the surgical treatment for hernia is aimed at locally correcting the physiological defects caused by the disorder, thus requiring fewer and smaller incisions. By repairing only the affected regions of the groin and by leaving the healthy tissues intact, this new form of surgery has revolutionized the medical treatment for hernia. The “Minimal-Repair Technique” is faster, more reliable and very safe. This procedure leaves no visible scars and it considerably speeds up the patients’ post-operative recovery. While patients who suffer traditional hernia surgery require a long period of hospitalization, most patients treated through this new medical procedure can leave the hospital a few hours after the operation. Furthermore, the “Minimal-Repair Technique” enables patients to recover completely within 14 days after the surgery. The “Minimal-Repair Technique” has been embraced by doctors worldwide and it is now considered to be among the safest and most reliable options in the treatment for hernia. This new medical approach in the surgical treatment for hernia is especially recommended to professional athletes, who are now able to continue their practice within only a few days after surgery. The “Minimal-Repair Technique” provides remarkable results and has proved to be a very safe alternative to open surgery, as the risks of post-operative complications have been virtually eliminated. Thanks to its advantages, the “Minimal-Repair Technique” is nowadays preferred by both patients and medical surgeons in the detriment of traditional surgery. This new approach in the treatment for hernia has become very popular lately and it is nowadays rated as one of the best forms of surgery."},{title:"Chamomile Oil Which Chamomile Is Which",body:"Chamomile is known worldwide to be a calming sleep aid, a remedy to ease an upset stomach, and for its wonderful anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmolytic properties. There are, however, many types of chamomile: Roman chamomile, Anthemis nobilis; German chamomile, Matricaria recutita; true Moroccan chamomile, Tanacetum annuum. Beyond these three basic types, German chamomile can also be called Hungarian or blue chamomile, while another species of chamomile called Moroccan is actually a different variety (Ormensis multicaulis) that is grown in Morocco. Ormensis multicaulis does not have the ink-blue color of the true Moroccan chamomile that is Tanacetum annuum, also called blue tansy. Each chamomile is a different variety, however they all have similar constituents as well as some likenesses in appearance.\n\nRoman chamomile is mainly grown in England, and there are some areas in continental Europe and the United States that also distill the oil. In 1785, Carlo Allioni, an Italian botanist, placed what we know as Roman chamomile in the genus Chamaemelum, naming Anthemis nobilis as Chamaemelum nobile, thus furthering the confusion about chamomiles.\n\nGerman chamomile is what most botanists and herbalists refer to as chamomile. German chamomile grows wild mostly in Germany, however what is known as blue or German chamomile has for the past 10 years or so been mainly distilled in Hungary, yet it retains the name German chamomile.\n\nMoroccan chamomile is a member of the Tansy botanical family and is like German chamomile due to the fact that they both produce a deep, ink-blue color when in the form of an essential oil. Out of the two varieties, Moroccan chamomile has the highest levels of chamazulene; however there are some chamomiles that have the name Moroccan Chamomile that are not blue in color. They are appelled Moroccan chamomile because they are a variety of chamomile that is grown in Morocco. True Tanacetum annuum is blue and contains the highest levels of chamazulene; however, there is some concern with Tanacetum annum, also called blue tansy oil. Tansy oil has been purported to have some toxicity and should not be used directly on the skin. On the other hand, there are aromatherapists who rave about the wonderful effects of Tanacetum annuum. Research on Tanacetum annuum’s constituents and general actions is incomplete and there is not enough clinical data recorded to make any conclusions about safety or effectiveness.\n\nChamazulene is the constituent in both German and Moroccan chamomiles that makes them blue and gives them strong anti-inflammatory qualities. Chamazulene does not show up as a constituent of German Chamomile until the distillation process because chamazulene is bound with glycoside Matricine, which is a sugar molecule that becomes hydrolysed due to the pressure and heat of the steam distillation process of extracting the essential oil. The volatile azulenes become unbound and alpha-bisabolol and chamazulene are then freed and show as newly present constituents of chamomile oil.\n\nGerman and Moroccan Chamomile are recognized for their anti-inflammatory properties and have been know to help cure and treat allergies, dermatitis, eczema, inflamed joints, muscles, neuralgia, skin rashes and sprains. German Chamomile is what is typically chosen to make chamomile tea and is an excellent natural anti-histamine for reactions such as hay fever, asthma and hives. Caveat emptor      "

Corroborated with proper rest, an appropriate diet and plenty of fluids, natural remedies can quickly deal with the undesirable effects of strep throat.\n\nChamomile tea is one of the best natural remedies for strep throat. Its analgesic properties can provide rapid relief for throat pain and headaches. Administered every few hours, chamomile tea can also reduce fever and prevent dehydration. A very strong natural remedy, sage can reduce inflammation, protecting the soft tissues of the throat and respiratory system. Sage can be used either under the form of tincture or under the form of capsules. Thanks to its antibiotic properties, garlic is also an appropriate home remedy for strep throat. \n\nGargling with salt water can fight against bacteria and can reduce throat inflammation and pain, while saline nasal sprays can help decongest the airways clogged with mucus. When suffering from strep throat, it is very important to maintain a warm temperature in your bedroom and to increase the air humidity by using mist humidifiers. You should avoid exposure to chemicals or irritants such as cigarette smoke and alcohol vapors. You should keep away from any substance with strong, persistent odor in order to prevent further inflammation of the respiratory system’s soft tissues and membranes. It is recommended to avoid drinking cold or very hot beverages, as they can cause throat irritation and pain, slowing down the process of healing. Also, keep away from spicy and irritant foods, as they are not tolerated well by an inflamed throat. When suffering from strep throat, you should only eat soft foods such as soups, yogurts, mashed potatoes, and non-irritant fruits."},{title:"Colon Flush For An Overall Well Being",body:"Bowel related problems have become an integral part of the lives of the average Americans, thanks to the abundance of fast foods in their diet. Low vitality, stomach bloat, poor digestion– are all the natural corollaries of irregular bowel movements. Add to it foul body odor, bad breath and a lackluster skin…together they indicate to one common point and that is; your colon is not in the proper state and it needs immediate attention.\n\nNow the question is how do you ensure the health of your colon? It is simple, go for colon cleansing at regular intervals. There are mainly two different ways to cleanse the colon. The first is to consume high fiber supplements and second is to flush the colon with water. In the second case where the colon is provided large amount of fluids, it actually flushes itself to get rid of the fecal matters and toxins accumulated in its walls for years. The end result is: you get a clean inside and get back the vitality of health.\n\nHow does the colon flush help you to get back to the previous healthy and energetic state? To know this you have to first learn the importance of colon with regard to our over all health.\n\nColon is the organ responsible for conserving water in the body and eliminating the wastes from system. It also stimulates the growth of the beneficial organisms that help our body to absorb the essential nutrients like vitamin K or B complex. As a result of growing age, flawed dietary practice, stress and exposure to pollution robs our colon off its natural resilience. The passage of elimination no longer remains smooth and fecal matters are built up in the walls of colon leading to accumulation of toxins. These toxins are circulated over other parts of the body through blood and the lymphatic system. This results in a number of disorders like diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, poor skin, joint pains, and depression.\n\nNow a good colon cleansing system is one which is divided into three steps: first it prepares the colon by creating the right environment for starting with the next and most important step of flushing. It can be achieved by consuming oral supplements.\n\nColon flush is the second step in which all the encrusted waste materials are flushed away from the digestive system. In this step, mainly the fluids are used to force out the internal debris accumulated for years. Also known as hydrotherapy or colonic irrigation, a colon flush ensures a thoroughly cleansed intestine.\n\nIn the last stage helpful Probiotics are introduced to support the overall health of digestive system.\n\nIn a nut shell, colon flush destroys the causes of toxin build up in the body. This is a process that triggers off energy regeneration naturally. Colon flush enables your body to repair itself and thus keeps the dangerous diseases at bay."},{title:"Diet And Cure For Candida Infections",body:"Candidiasis can be a pesky infection to treat, more so since the pharmaceutical treatment for such includes the use of powerful systemic antifungals. These antifungals may cause side effects that may even rival the illness it was made to treat. However, there have been breakthroughs in the treatment of systemic yeast infections that focus on more natural means of treating the illness.\n\nCandidiasis is caused by the overgrowth of the fungus Candida Albicans. This fungus exists naturally in the body, especially in the intestines. Normally, they would not cause any harm to a healthy body. Unfortunately, though, if there is an overgrowth of these fungi, it could cause a systemic infection (an infection that affects your whole body). In the case of Candidiasis, the fungus, due to its abnormal numbers, releases toxins that could harm the internal organs and the mucus membranes. If it manifests in the throat it is called thrush, and vaginitis if it occurs in the vagina.\n\nThere is a proven connection between systemic yeast infection and chronic fatigue syndrome. Candidiasis is also responsible for skin infections and causes chronic vaginal yeast infections.\n\nThe symptoms of a Candidiasis infection include:\n\n1. Itchiness, burning, and abnormal discharge in the vagina (classic symptoms of vaginitis).\n\n2. Intestinal and digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, heartburn, flatulence, bloating of the stomach area, diarrhea, constipation.\n\n3. Yeast infections also cause trouble breathing, respiratory ailments such as sneezing, congestion, and wheezing.\n\n4. A state of always feeling fatigued. This is called the chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n5. A plethora of nervous illnesses such as depression, anxiety, being irritable, poor concentration and memory.\n\n6. Candidiasis also causes irregularities in menstruation and PMS.\n\nA Candida diet has been shown to be effective in curing or reducing the systemic infection anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months depending on the severity of the infection. If one sticks rigidly to the diet, relief can occur in a shorter amount of time.\n\nThe principle of the diet is to starve the yeast in the body and create a biological environment that is hostile to the yeast. If you are a Candidiasis patient given a strict Candida Diet, you will be asked to remove processed sugars from your diet. The yeast in your body needs this sugar to survive, and removing such sugars from your diet will effectively starve them to death.\n\nYou will also be encouraged to remove white starch from your diet, along with processed foods and oils. If possible you will be discouraged from taking antibiotics, steroids and cortisone.\n\nYou must make sure that the protein sources in your diet are free from chemicals, hormones, steroids, antibiotics and other synthetic elements. A safe bet would be fish, and fowl that are not grown at poultries. Meat grown at poultries and farms are usually given antibiotics and steroids to both keep them away from disease and to expedite growth. The chemicals these animals have been exposed to have a secondary effect on those that consume these products.\n\nYou may be asked to take supplements such as Omega-3 rich oils, which is very lacking in the American diet. Fish oils, salmon, tuna, primrose oil, and sardines are rich in this. Dietary supplements containing these oils are also available and may be taken with the consent of your physician.\n\nNote: This article may be freely reproduced as long as the AUTHOR’S resource box at the bottom of this article is included and and all links must be Active/Linkable with no syntax changes."},{title:"Your Prescription For Sinus Headache Reflief",body:"“Prevention is better than cure.” Well said and well understood! But there are certain types of headaches, which are part and parcel of you; gifted to you by birth! Sinus headache is one of them, unfortunately.\n\nMany say about sinus, “that which can not be cured, must be endured!’ You can control it, reduce its impact. Can it be ever eradicated? The answer is in the negative, as far as the present day medical research can take you!\n\nIn sinus, invariably you have the headache, but every headache is not sinus! Sinus and nasal passage problems are the cause of headache, mostly! It is not that you have pain in the sinus area and you need to conclude that you have a sinus disorder. When the nasal passage and sinus are inflamed, it can result in a severe headache. In acute chronic sinus, the intensity of headache varies with the severity of the sinus. Sinus patients complain about many other problems. The sinus patient is more likely to experience:\n\n1. Chills and fevers\n\n2. Swelling of face\n\n3. Nasal stiffness\n\n4. Tension in the upper teeth, which will give lots of pain\n\n5. Or, yellow or green discharge.\n\nIf you are suffering from sinus, you must live a controlled life, and must remain highly disciplined, with regard to the diet. There are strict laws as far as do’s and don’ts are concerned! Singers will have to take special care about maintaining the vocal chords of their throats! Sinus remains ever ready to sabotage their plans.\n\nPranaayama and Yoga asanas go a long way in controlling and curing the sinus headache! Regular light exercise must be done and tough and heavy exercises need to be avoided. The use of steam vaporizer must become the part of your life, if you detect the sinus! Develop the habit of morning walk. Do not walk too briskly or too slowly, and avoid too chilly or too hot days. Breathe moist air.\n\nSinus and headache are two different problems. When they club together and make a joint attack on you, your only defense is to find out the root cause of their arrival and then check them. So far, it has not been possible for the medical science and research, to defeat the sinus headache. But to erect barricades in its onward march is certainly possible!"},{title:"Natural Home Remedies For Oily Skin",body:"There are many reasons for your skin to become oily for e.g. hereditary, pregnancy, environment, food we eat and many others.

It all happened through the use of Botox by plastic surgeons. Patients undergoing plastic surgery, who were also experiencing headaches, noticed that their injections of Botox helped with their migraine headaches. Botox, also known as botulinum toxin, is a neurotoxin (a toxin that attacks nerve cells). It was originally approved by the FDA for use in conditions where hyperactivity of muscles was an underlying problem of related health and medical conditions. The theory is that Botox weakens or paralyzes muscles by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is an ester of choline that is thought to play an important role in the transmission of nerve impulses at synapses and myoneural (muscle-nerve) junctions. By inhibiting the release of acetylcholine the nerves cannot cause a muscle contraction, thus relaxing the muscle. Botox is administered by being directly injected into the affected muscles.\n\nThere are differing theories as to how Botox works to eliminate migraine headaches, but the exact reasoning remains unclear. One theory is that muscle tension and spasms are a cause of migraines and by eliminating the muscle tension with an injection of Botox it will also eliminate the cause of the headaches. If given Botox before the headache begins it is possible to eliminate the headache before it even starts. When muscles spasm it can irritate nerves that innervate them. When these nerves send signals to the brain in an increased amount it causes pain and possibly headaches. Botox may affect these nerve cells, inhibiting their transmission, causing a lessening of the perception of pain. Many researches think that migraine headaches are a result of inflammation of blood vessels. However, muscle tension may also play an important role in the cause of headaches. When researchers test a medication’s effectiveness they usually test it through a double-blind study. This means that some patients are given the medication being tested while others are given a placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance, such as sugar, that is given in place of the medication that is being evaluated. Some tests have been performed that did not involve double-blind studies, but showed that Botox could prevent migraine headaches. One double-blind study involving Botox and headaches showed only a small positive effect. Initial studies may not have shown the full effectiveness of Botox for the prevention of headaches. The injections were not placed in the typical locations of the headache pain, but in areas normally injected during plastic surgery. In subsequent studies, using larger doses and injecting into more specific localities for the headache pain, the results were improved. These tests were concerning migraine headaches. However, with tension headaches, or muscle tension headaches, the studies have shown improved results. This is to be expected due to the weakening or paralyzing nature of Botox on the muscles that are experiencing tension. When being injected with Botox for the prevention of headaches it may take several weeks before the injection takes effect. For this reason it is usually necessary to have it injected no more often than once every 3 months or so. People that have Botox administered for the treatment of headaches typically need it injected every few months. If there is too long of an interval between injections the headaches may be experienced by the patient.\n\nHowever, the question arises about the safety of these regular injections of a neurotoxin. Since 1989, when it was first used as a headache treatment, it has appeared to be fairly safe. Most migraine headache medications are taken orally and eventually end up in the blood stream. Because of this common symptoms of migraine headache medication will be dizziness and drowsiness among other symptoms. Since Botox is injected directly into the muscle tissue and does not get absorbed into the blood system as does the typical headache medicine there are fewer side effects. Most commonly, the only side effects of injecting this neurotoxin is pain in the area of injection for a couple of days or drooping of the eyelids for a few days.\n\nStudies are still being performed on this medication and as yet the FDA has not approved it for the treatment of headaches. However, physicians do prescribe it to their patients and if you think you are a candidate to use it you should discuss it with your doctor. If you do not respond to other headache medications it may be something to talk with your physician about. As the studies continue the effects and safety issues involving this medication should become more clear."},{title:"Points To Remember About A Spastic Colon",body:"Did you know that nearly half of the population of the developed countries like USA and Canada suffer from the disorders caused by spastic colon? It is a chronic health problem that affects a number of people which is far greater than the number of population suffering from diabetes, asthma or depression.\n\nAt this point you are wondering what spastic colon actually is. Let us put it like this: It is a kind of dysfunction of colon in which the passage of wastes through the intestine is obstructed due to the changes in the normal pattern of muscular contractions of colon that mobilize wastes. Spastic colon is typically a functional disorder and not a disease, which implies that bowel movement is not occurring in a manner it should have been. The result is either constipation or diarrhea or in many cases a bout of both in alternate succession. The other symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, painful bowel movement and stool full of mucus. In women, there is a close relation between menstruation and attack of spastic colon. It has led the medical practitioners establish a correlation between hormonal changes and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nDealing with spastic colon is rather easy; you have to incorporate little changes in your lifestyle. To begin with, bring in little changes in your food habit to get rewarded by a problem free bowel movement. First of all try to understand which foods trigger off the symptoms and religiously avoid them. Generally cut down on the fat content in your diet and go for baked or micro waved foods instead of those fried or roasted. If you have a fetish for milk products, then consumes only skimmed or semi skimmed milk.\n\nMore importantly, take the foods that are rich in fiber and increase the proportion of fresh vegetables and whole grain cereals in your diet. Another simple rule is: divide your entire meal of the day in small portions and eat more often but small amount at a time. Yoghurt provides a natural solution to those suffering from static colon, as yoghurt containing helpful bacteria aids in the digestive process.\n\nSecond important point in dealing with static colon is to managing stress. Under the circumstances of twenty first century living, stress management may sound rather an impossible task. But if you want to get a problem free bowel habit, you have to learn to cope up with stress factors through such practices as meditation, aerobics exercise with music, relaxing over the weekends completely cutting off from the work related anxieties and availing other relaxation therapies.\n\nIf things go really bad, go and see the doctor at earliest. The faster you address the problem with proper medication, earlier you get relief from irregular bowel syndrome. But above all you should stick to a healthy lifestyle; that is the best guarantee for having a problem free colon and overall health."},{title:"Aromatherapy While Traveling",body:"Whether you are on business trip, a romantic holiday, a family trip or simply want to experience outdoor life, aromatherapy essential oils come useful along the way.

The primary effect of cataract is blurred vision. Then, what is cataract and how does it develop? The word cataract is derived from Latin word cataracta which means waterfall. It is metaphorically imported into the modern English for its blurring effect on the eye.\n\nWhat Is Cataract\n\nCataract is clouding of the eye lens, mostly due to aging, barring a small percentage of other secondary reasons like diabetes, sustained exposure to ultraviolet light etc. The US National Institutes of Health and National Eye Institute have estimated that over half of Americans above the age of 80 will develop cataract or have already developed.\n\nIf you did not know already, cataract will not spread from eye to eye, but can occur in either or both eyes.\n\nWhat Causes Cataracts to Develop?\n\nMost age related cataracts develop in either of the two ways discussed here.\n\n1. Protein clumping is one of the main reasons for clouding of the lens. This occurs when lens proteins begin to denature as a result of aging. You may not be able to notice the difference when cataract is small but as it grows and spreads, eye sight gets worse and eyeglasses and stronger lighting can help cope up until surgery is an absolute necessity.\n\n2. With the aging of lens, it looses its natural clarity and may add a tint of yellow or brown. As with protein induced cataract, you may not be able to notice the browning or blurring of vision initially. But with the passage of time and increase in browning, reading and routine activities get affected. The one difference in tinted cataract is, the vision sharpness will not reduce but identifying colors like blues and purples will be difficult.\n\nHow Do I Know if I Have Cataract\n\nCataract will not show signs until at least it has developed partially. However these are the common symptoms.\n\n1. Faded colors and blurred vision\n\n2. Poor night vision but headlights and sunlight may appear all too bright with a halo around the source.\n\n3. Temporary double or multiple visions which gets cleared as cataract develops further.\n\n4. Frequent need to change contact lenses or spectacles.\n\nWho Is At Risk? Should I Worry?\n\nThose who indulge in alcoholism or those who are exposed to UV light for a long time are at danger of developing cataract. Even diabetics face the same risk.\n\nDifferent Types of Cataract\n\n1. Secondary cataracts as an after effect of eye surgery, like in the case of glaucoma\n\n2. Congenital cataracts in new born babies, which in rare cases lead to lens replacement\n\n3. Traumatic cataracts due to eye injuries. These have very late onsets Early symptoms are taken care off by eyeglasses but when everyday life gets affected after its complete development, surgery is the proven way."},{title:"Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs As A Serious Risk Factor For Ulcer",body:"Ulcer is a common type of digestive disorder that can affect different levels of the gastrointestinal system. Ulcer generally causes inflammation and open lesions to the soft tissues and organs of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common types of ulcer are duodenal and stomach ulcer. While most duodenal ulcers are mild, stomach ulcers can lead to serious complications such as perforation of the stomach wall and internal bleeding. In some cases, stomach ulcer can eventually lead to gastric cancer, a life-threatening disease. There are various causes and risk factors of stomach ulcer. The major causes of stomach ulcer are infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria and the stomach’s overproduction of digestive fluids. The categories at risk of developing stomach ulcer are: people with ages over 50, smokers, people who have suffered abdominal surgery, people who have acquired abdominal injuries and people who follow ongoing treatments with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).  Recent studies have revealed that certain medications have a great contribution in the occurrence of stomach ulcer. Commonly prescribed in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs greatly increase the risk of developing stomach ulcer. These drugs affect the digestive system on multiple levels: they weaken the mucosal protective cover of the internal organs; they stimulate an overproduction of gastric acid and pepsin; they perturb the blood circulation at the level of the stomach.\n\nDiclofenac is a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribed in the treatment of arthritis. This medication is known to block the body’s production of cox enzymes, chemicals that have a very important role in renewing the stomach’s protective mucosal cover, considerably increasing the risk of developing stomach ulcer. Statistics indicate that ongoing treatment with Diclofenac is responsible for causing more than 150.000 new annual cases of ulcer in the United States. Furthermore, an annual number of 10.000 patients who follow prolonged treatments with this drug are expected to die as a consequence of ulcer complications.  Although new generation non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Celebrex are considered to be safe, most patients who follow prolonged treatments with these medications also develop ulcer or other gastrointestinal disorders. Recent studies indicate that more than 10 percent of patients who receive ongoing treatment for arthritis develop recurrent ulcers. In time, some of these patients also develop serious complications such as perforated or bleeding ulcers. In present, medical science is unable to replace non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with other safer medications. Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have many side-effects, they are also the primary option in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. In order to prevent the occurrence of ulcer in patients who receive such medication treatments, this category of people should benefit from frequent medical examinations."},{title:"What Is Cataract Sugery And How Does It Work",body:"Cataract surgery involves the surgical removal of the lens of an eye that has formed a cataract. Cataract extraction is the one of the most common eye surgeries performed and is widely regarded as being one of the safest procedures in the medical community. A cataract occurs when the crystalline lens of the eye becomes cloudy or opaque as a result of age, illness, or trauma. This cloudiness can interfere with the eye’s natural ability to direct light and focus an image on the retina. As a result, individuals with cataracts frequently experience a loss of vision. There is no known way to reverse the damage caused by cataracts, although the complete removal and replacement of the affected lens with an artificial lens can restore an individual’s vision. The two most common procedures for cataract extraction are called ICCE (intracapsular cataract extraction) and ECCE (extracapsular cataract extraction). Both of these procedures are typically done under a local anesthetic on an out-patient basis, so cataract surgery patients are free to go home the same day.\n\nExtra-capsular surgery involves the removal of the affected lens while leaving the majority of the elastic lens capsule intact. This allows for the direct implantation of an intraocular lens into the lens capsule. Extracapsular surgery may be performed using one of two methods: conventional ECCE or phacoemulsification. Conventional ECCE involves making a small incision into the cornea or the sclera of the eye. The cataract is then manually removed through the incision so that a replacement intraocular lens can be inserted. Conventional ECCE is best suited for those patients who suffer from very hard cataracts or who have a weak or thin epithelium covering the cornea. The second method, phacoemulsification, makes use of an ultrasonic handpiece. Ultrasound waves vibrate the cataract, causing it to shatter and break up into a number of small pieces. These pieces are then removed through aspiration via a small incision in the cornea, after which a replacement intraocular lens can be inserted. Phacoemulsification uses a much smaller incision and may not even require stitches, with the result that this procedure often affords patients a shorter recovery period. Intra-capsular surgery involves the removal of the entire lens of the eye including the lens capsule. This procedure was commonplace up until the 1980’s in the United States, but is rarely performed today due to medical advances in cataract surgery. To extract the lens the surgeon makes a large incision in the cornea and injects medicine into the eye. This causes the zonular fibers that hold the lens in position to break apart and dissolve. A small probe is inserted into the incision and placed on the lens so that it may be frozen via a cryogenic solution, such as liquid nitrogen. The probe is then withdrawn from the eye, pulling with it the frozen lens. Once the affected lens has been removed, an intraocular lens implant may be inserted in front of the iris as a replacement. Finally the incision is stitched up. Intra-capsular surgery has a high risk of complications due to the pressure that is placed on the vitreous body of the eye during the procedure. Patients have a prolonged period of healing (up to 6 weeks), and are at a high risk for retinal detachment and swelling of the eye. It is for this reason that nearly all modern cataract extractions are performed via the extracapsular surgery method."

It is a very common occurrence like cold or fever depending upon your lifestyle. The common forms of blisters are the ones wherein the blister is raised and filled with a liquid. These blisters can form on any part of your body mainly hands and feet where there is more friction.\n\nThe different types of blister are fever blisters, blood blisters, and friction blister which is the most common blister among the three. Fever blisters are formed around your mouth, chin, cheeks or nostrils. These can also be found in your mouth but are smaller than canker sores. Friction blisters are caused by friction by doing things with your bare hands, wearing a new shoe, due to heat, frostbite, chemical injury or friction. Blood blisters are mainly developed due to a smash or punching injury. This kind of injury ticker the blood between the skin layers causing it to be a blood blister.\n\nSelf-Care Measures\n\nThe first thing to do for a blister, if it is due to burns is to put pour or soak the injured part in ice-water.\n\nHow to avoid blisters on your feet?

This is because the air we breathe has carbon byproducts and the water we drink has heavy metals and the food we eat is not as natural as it should be. Most of it is chemically enhanced or genetically modified one way or the other. All these things make the statement that “We live in a very toxic age” very true! In order to live longer and healthier there is a growing need to detoxify our bodies. If you don’t detox regularly, these poisonous substances from the air you breath, the water you drink and the food you eat will lead to ill-health such as insomnia, gastric problems, poor skin, premature aging due to accumulation of toxins over the years and ultimately untimely death. You can decide to naturally detox or take herbs and vitamins to detox. A lot of people choose to detox naturally because they know the body has its own ability to clean itself up.\n\nOur bodies have natural defenses and resources that work to constantly to clean up our systems, even when we sleep. Unfortunately, most people’s bodies are unable to detox mainly because of poor health. If the body is performing at optimal level, it should be able to detox itself. As I’ve mentioned before, because of the polluted air, water and food we eat, it becomes impossible for anyone’s body to perform at optimal level.

Low vitality, stomach bloat, poor digestion– are all the natural corollaries of irregular bowel movements. Add to it foul body odor, bad breath and a lackluster skin…together they indicate to one common point and that is; your colon is not in the proper state and it needs immediate attention.\n\nNow the question is how do you ensure the health of your colon? It is simple, go for colon cleansing at regular intervals. There are mainly two different ways to cleanse the colon. The first is to consume high fiber supplements and second is to flush the colon with water. In the second case where the colon is provided large amount of fluids, it actually flushes itself to get rid of the fecal matters and toxins accumulated in its walls for years. The end result is: you get a clean inside and get back the vitality of health.\n\nHow does the colon flush help you to get back to the previous healthy and energetic state? To know this you have to first learn the importance of colon with regard to our over all health.\n\nColon is the organ responsible for conserving water in the body and eliminating the wastes from system. It also stimulates the growth of the beneficial organisms that help our body to absorb the essential nutrients like vitamin K or B complex. As a result of growing age, flawed dietary practice, stress and exposure to pollution robs our colon off its natural resilience. The passage of elimination no longer remains smooth and fecal matters are built up in the walls of colon leading to accumulation of toxins. These toxins are circulated over other parts of the body through blood and the lymphatic system. This results in a number of disorders like diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, poor skin, joint pains, and depression.\n\nNow a good colon cleansing system is one which is divided into three steps: first it prepares the colon by creating the right environment for starting with the next and most important step of flushing. It can be achieved by consuming oral supplements.\n\nColon flush is the second step in which all the encrusted waste materials are flushed away from the digestive system. In this step, mainly the fluids are used to force out the internal debris accumulated for years. Also known as hydrotherapy or colonic irrigation, a colon flush ensures a thoroughly cleansed intestine.\n\nIn the last stage helpful Probiotics are introduced to support the overall health of digestive system.\n\nIn a nut shell, colon flush destroys the causes of toxin build up in the body. This is a process that triggers off energy regeneration naturally. Colon flush enables your body to repair itself and thus keeps the dangerous diseases at bay."},{title:"How Is Leukemia Treated",body:"Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. There are two types of leukemia, chronic and acute, which are treated differently and have different symptoms. Acute leukemia rapidly progresses and needs immediate, aggressive treatment. Chronic leukemia can take months or years to show symptoms and may not need immediate treatment but will require ongoing monitoring.\n\nChemotherapy utilizes chemicals to treat the cancer. It causes many side effects such as hair loss, nausea and decline of the immune system. The complete course of therapy can be from two to five years including maintenance. This is the most common form of treatment for leukemia with the desired result being total remission. Even without symptoms, ongoing monitoring must occur to guard against relapse.\n\nRadiation therapy is another form of treatment. It is painless and in low doses causes very few side effects. Where the radiation is concentrated and the exposure levels will determine the side effects, if any, and the severity of them. Damage to the skin, swelling and infertility are among the possible side effects. A bone marrow transplant is an effective way to prolong the life of cancer patients. It is, however, a risky surgery and requires a donor which can be difficult in attaining. These surgeries should be performed at state of the art hospitals specializing in cancer treatment. This surgery has a high mortality rate and is therefore used only in life threatening cases.\n\nImmunotherapy is a means to stimulate the immune system so the body can attack the cancer cells. This type of treatment is still in its early stages and continually under development. It is believed that this type of treatment may prove less harmful than chemotherapy or radiation therapy and may someday supplant these treatments as a method for treating cancer. Long term effects of leukemia treatments may cause anemia. This side effect can be treated by blood transfusions or platelet transfusions. There are risks with transfusions but it is believed transfusions will help reduce the threat of additional complications such as heart attacks. Doses of antibiotics are also generally prescribed to leukemia patients to help counteract the danger of infection cause by declined immune system or treatment side effects.\n\nThere are currently almost 200,000 people in the United States diagnosed with leukemia and an estimated 35,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year. It is the leading cause of death for people under the age of 20. There are many treatment facilities throughout the United States specializing in cancer treatment. Early diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and monitoring will help prolong life and increase chances of a person going into remission."},{title:"Understanding Drug And Alcohol Rehabilitation",body:"For many years, when people thought of alcohol and drug rehab, the image that almost immediately came to mind was most likely a group of people, sitting in a circle in folding chairs in a big vacant room. Its true that group programs still aid many people in their quest to stop drinking and using illegal substances but most who have fell too deep into their addictions do not find relief this way. There is good news for those who need help getting over their addictions – slowly, there has been a proliferation of alternative therapies to alcohol and drug rehab. These methods may prove useful when traditional rehabilitation methods fail. 1. Why Do People Get Addictions?\n\nThe reasons for addiction are complicated and vary with each and every individual. These same reasons may be difficult for us to understand, and even a lot more difficult to resolve. Drug and alcohol rehab in recent years has taken a hard and diverse approach to the problem of addiction. Taking in consideration are the physical, emotional, and even nutritional factors that may be causes. Whether you’re seeking help for yourself or whether you are a concerned friend or family member of someone who is in a very dangerous grip of addiction, be confident that you are not the only one. Addictions come in varied forms, some are dangerous and some are not. 2. The Physiological Approach\n\nIt doesn’t mean that just because you are encountering a dangerous addiction it’s alright to think that you are different from everyone else. It only means that you’ll need to seek out specially qualified help. Many physiological and chemical imbalances that occur in our bodies and brains may contribute or cause our feelings of depression, that can lead us into addiction as we try to self medicate to compensate for our emotional distress. We are living in an era where many problems like chemical depression and blood sugar imbalances are easily diagnosed and treated. Often, addicts who treat these underlying problems will experience great relief from the urge to feel better by drinking.\n\n3. Blood Chemistry\n\nThe best and most popular idea we have of drug rehabilitation is the old 12-step group therapy that we so often see on television shows and movies. The fact is, science has a lot more to tell us about how our bodies and brains respond to all kinds of substances. A lot of evidence suggests that when a physiological or chemical imbalance is occurs in the brain no matter what the cause, that individual will try to compensate for the imbalance he is experiencing by self-medicating with drugs. Modern drug rehab programs often use this approach to look for chemical brain imbalances to help their patients recover. In addition to this, imbalances in blood chemistry can also lead to drug and alcohol addiction. Having problems such as low blood sugar can lead someone to self medicate so that he can cure any fatigue or anxiety that he may be feeling. A balanced nutritional intake and exercise have shown themselves to be aids in the process of drug rehab. \n\nUsually people who are deeply addicted often have neglected themselves, so by finding a diet and exercise program, it can really lift their self image. Another advantage of exercise to anyone who is an addict is that it also provides a natural high that can help an addict to get through the rough periods in his rehabilitation. Some individuals may be comfortable with the idea of group counseling while some may have difficulty in comprehending it. An option for these kinds of people is one on one therapy, where a therapist can reach out to the deepest and most personal aspects of an addict’s life. Looking for answers for addiction and possible recovery is an extremely difficult task to anyone. It takes a lot of devotion and time to even see the smallest of developments. Being able to find the right place to do the work toward recovery is an important step. The wants needs of each and every addict are different from each other, and the process of finding a place to fully recover can be a very deep, difficult, personal and intense process."},{title:"Toads And Warts",body:"It was a popular myth in the old days that you can get warts from toads. Not true – now we know that’s bogus. Warts are actually benign tumors of the epidermis caused by a virus. The virus responsible is the human papillomavirus, a double-stranded DNA-virus.\n\nThe virus resides in the bottom layer of the epidermis and replicates into almost normal-looking skin. Different sub-types of the human papillamavirus cause different types of warts. Some subtypes also cause cervical cancer and other more obscure types of wart-related cancers.\n\nAnother myth about warts is that they have “roots” but warts do not have “roots”. They only grow in the top layer of skin, the epidermis. When they grow down, they displace the second layer of skin, the dermis. The underside of a wart is actually smooth. Warts are caused by a virus that enters the body through a break in the skin. The virus grows in warm, moist environments, such as those created in a locker room or in your shoes when your feet perspire and the moisture is trapped.\n\nWarts normally grow out of the skin in cylindrical columns and they do not fuse when the wart grows on thin skin such as the face. On thicker skin, the columns fuse and are packed tightly together giving the surface the typical mosaic pattern. Dark dots can sometimes be seen in a wart and it is actually blood vessels that have grown rapidly and irregularly into the wart and have thombosed or clotted off.\n\nWarts can occur in people of all ages, but hit most often children and young adults. They spread by direct contact, simply by touching the wart. Most warts resolve within weeks or months, some may take years. Although that is unusual and persons prefer to treat the warts very quick.\n\nIt appears that a person’s susceptibility to warts and the time it takes for them to go away is related to the individual’s immune system. People who have immune-related diseases tend to have more warts that last longer.\n\nWhat kind of treatment is there?\n\nMost warts can be treated with simple over-the-counter remedies. For those that are resistant to these measures, there are other types of treatments that are effective.\n\nIn your local drug store you may find good working remedies. Try it and if it works, great. If it does not work you lost a few days and some dollars. Then you will perhaps search for a professional opinion from a doctor and they will probably recommend you some of the following treatments.\n\nSalicylic acid is very common and an effective over-the-counter treatment. You have to do a consistent application every day. The best way to use salicylic acid is to first pare the wart with a blade, pumice stone or a small scrub brush. Soaking the wart in warm water will aid to get a better absorption of the medicine. Salicylic acid is then applied to the wart and allowed to dry. Occluding the treated wart with a band-aid or piece of tape also improves the absorption of the medicine. This procedure should be repeated daily.\n\nIf the wart is resistant to your treatment, your physician may recommend an office procedure to remove it. After a local anesthetic is applied, the physician may use liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart and dissolve it. To avoid scarring or damaging other tissues, this method removes only the top portion of the wart. The treatment must be repeated regularly until the entire wart is dissolved. Alternatively, the physician can cut out the wart.\n\nThe human papillomavirus is not killed by cryotherapy and is released into the surrounding tissue. The immune system will usually take care of the virus. You will have a blister as a side-effect of the treatment. Nothing to think about unless you have the warts on the bottom of the foot. Then you should perhaps choose another treatment.\n\nSome warts will go away, your immune system take care of them. If not, you will have a number of treatments available that will most certainly work well."},{title:"Treating Neck And Back Injuries",body:"Many people experience neck and back injuries on a frequent basis. Either from work related injuries or from just moving the wrong way. Your neck and back are easy to injure. There are many pills that you will be prescribed to relieve the pain. But these pills do not fix the problem, they only dull the pain for a small period of time. More frequently, alternative treatments are being used to cure these injuries. Injuries of the neck and back can be some of the more painful injuries and you will find yourself debilitated for that period of time while waiting for your pills to work. This is no way to live. Alternative treatments are very reliable in this field and will fix your injury and heal your pain. These methods are not as obscure as they used to be. They are becoming more and more popular. Not just for neck and back injuries but for many other illnesses as well. Let me outline for you the alternative treatments that would be best for these types of injuries.\n\nMassage Acupuncture Meditation\n\nThese forms of treatment can be used each separately or combine one or two of them together. Acupuncture should be the first one that you try. If you are not familiar with this technique, let me explain. Acupuncture is the art of inserting needles into certain key points of the body. It is believed that these key points release the stress and tension from your body. Stress and tension are the root of all pain. Once you get rid of this, you will start feeling better almost instantly. Acupuncture involves no pain, only relief. Massage is another great way to relieve pain. The art of massage is something that has been mastered by many people today. Massage will release all the tension from your muscles and put your body at ease. Massage is something that will need to be used several times in one month in order for it to be effective. Depending on the severity of your injury, you may have to go more frequently than this. Massage can help and it may even be a good idea to combine massage and acupuncture therapy together. Meditation is a very strong method of healing used as an alternative treatment. Meditation is a treatment that should be used as well as another treatment. Alternative or otherwise, meditation is a method that cures the soul and the mind. This may sound like it will not do anything for neck or back injuries, but this assumption would be wrong. The condition of your mind and soul are just as important as your physical condition. Meditation is an art. It take a lot of self discipline and concentration. It can work, if you put the effort in to make it work. In regards to injuries, it is best to combine meditation with acupuncture or massage. Meditation is something that you might want to begin using daily. It can help you for injuries but not only this, for other illnesses that you may have. Alternative treatments are great for curing injuries. Remember that it may be best to combine one or two of these treatments together for maximum effect. You can also combine your conventional medical treatments with one of these great alternative treatments. Maximum effect is what you are going for. It may be best for you to consult with a practitioner before you begin any alternative treatments. You can receive great advice and learn more and more about these alternative methods and feel more confident about using them. Finding a good practitioner is something that will help you get the full effect of alternative treatments. You can learn more than you ever thought about these methods and learn how to use them for your advantage. Alternative treatments can make a difference and cure your injuries with a great healing power."},{title:"Precautionary Measures For Hernia",body:"Hernia is an opening in the muscular structure of the wall of the abdomen. The weakness in the wall causes damage to the abdominal wall leading to protrusion through the thin membrane. The bulging contents usually remain in the naturally formed cavity. The contents of protrusion are mainly portions of intestines or abdominal fatty tissue. Even though theory mentions that hernia can occur anywhere but, the common region of occurrence is the abdominal area.\n\nSmall hernias are not much of a threat to you. But large hernias can cause heartburn and chest pain. They all run at a risk of getting their blood supply cut off, which is one of the problematic issues to deal with. When the contents in the hernia sac faces shortage of blood, it becomes a serious issue leading to surgical assistance.\n\nThere are different types of hernia\n\n– Inguinal hernia\n\n– Indirect inguinal hernia\n\n– Direct inguinal hernia\n\n– Femoral hernia\n\n– Umbilical hernia\n\n– Incisional hernia\n\n– Spigelian hernia\n\n– Obturator hernia\n\n– Epigastric hernia\n\nSome of the common causes leading to hernia\n\n– Umbilical hernia can be present at birth\n\n– Obesity\n\n– Lifting weights\n\n– Coughing\n\n– Straining during a bowel movement or urination\n\n– Lung disease\n\n– Presence of fluid in abdominal cavity\n\n– Hereditary\n\n– Pressure on abdomen during pregnancy\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hernia depend mainly on the type of hernia you are affected by.\n\n– Heartburn, worse when bending over or lying down\n\n– Chest pain\n\n– Belching\n\n– Soreness of the groin or pain in the groin by bending\n\n– A painless lump\n\n– Swollen or tender protrusion\n\n– Difficulty in swallowing\n\n– Chest pain\n\n– Blockage of the esophagus\n\nDon’ts\n\n– Reduce your food intake\n\n– Avoid bending or lying after your meal\n\n– Stop smoking\n\n– Prevent activities like lifting, coughing which increases intra-abdominal pressure leading to severe risk of hernia\n\n– Avoid alcohol\n\n– Keep off from foods which are hard to digest\n\n– Avoid depression\n\n– Do not wear tight clothes\n\nDo’s\n\n– Eat food rich in fiber in the form of fruits, vegetables and grains\n\n– Drink plenty of fluids to prevent constipation\n\n– Exercise regularly\n\n– Sweat and loose excess toxin\n\n– Join laughter club\n\n– Eat six small meals instead of 3 big meals\n\n– Have grains like barley and millet\n\n– Consume vegetables like cabbage, dandelion, sweet potatoes, artichoke\n\n– Have herbs in your diet like fennel, cumin, asafetida, mint, parsley, arrowroot, aloe vera and many more.\n\nRemedies\n\n– Eat Cayenne pepper\n\n– Drink warm tea in hot room and sweat it out\n\n– Keep a cloth soaked in rupturewort tea to the affected area for some relief\n\nWarning: The reader of this article should exercise all precautionary measures while following instructions on the home remedies from this article.

B vitamins, like vitamin C, are water soluble, which means that extra levels of B vitamins are excreted by the body, though small amounts are stored in the liver and toxicity, while rare, is possible.\n\nMost people will recognize many of the B vitamins by name. They include thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin (B1, 2, and 3, respectively), as well as folic acid (B9). The other four B vitamins are less commonly referred to and are: pyridoxine (B6), cyanocobalamin (B12), pantothenic acid, and biotin.\n\nThe B vitamins serve many functions in the body, including the breakdown of different kinds of foods into energy, maintenance and protection of the nervous system, production of blood cells, and maintenance of healthy skin.\n\nDeficiencies of most B vitamins are rare, because they are found in many different food sources. While sources abound though, deficiencies can exist if someone has a condition that affects their ability to absorb or use B vitamins. Whole grain breads and cereals contain thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid and folic acid. Milk contains riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin). Foods with lots of protein like eggs and meats contain B vitamins, especially red and organ meats.\n\nAlcoholics, along with being susceptible to many other health problems, can be vulnerable to thiamine deficiency, also known as beriberi. Alcohol prevents the body from properly absorbing thiamine and many alcoholics also do not eat otherwise healthy diets, so they are doubly prone to lacking this and other vitamins.\n\nRiboflavin is very active in the maintenance of skin and other tissues, so deficiency of this vitamin can cause skin lesions and dermatitis. There has been a lot in the news in the past couple of years about the importance of folic acid for women of child bearing age. Women who have adequate levels of folic acid when they get pregnant are less likely to have babies with neural tube defects. The folic acid must be present before pregnancy because these types of birth defects occur in the first weeks of pregnancy, and oftentimes women will not even know they are pregnant yet.\n\nYou may have heard of people getting B12 shots because of a deficiency of this vitamin called pernicious anemia. This occurs particularly in people over 60, because as we age, our stomachs have less ability to produce the substance intrinsic factor, which must combine with B12 taken through food or oral supplements in order to be absorbed by the body."},{title:"How To Quick And Easy Natural Massage Melts",body:"Massage melts are a unique body product because they stay solid at room temperatures, but when applied directly to your skin, start to soften and melt due to body temperature. Their main purpose is to moisturize dry skin, as well as, relax and soothe tight muscles. Essentially, massage bars are composed of natural butters and oils. Most recipes for this type of product call for the use of cocoa butter. Even though it has great moisturizing properties, I feel this butter produces too hard a product. Therefore, I recommend using such butters as shea and mango, which create a silkier, luxurious feeling to your melts. For oils, I highly recommend using sweet almond and jojoba. Sweet almond oil is light and penetrates easily making it well-suited for dry skin conditions. Plus, it is effective on all skin types. Jojoba oil, which is not actually an oil but is a liquid wax, is similar in composition to the oil your skin secretes, which is known as sebum. Jojoba is a quickly absorbed oil that soothes the skin, as well as, extends the shelf life of other oils. Other “light” oils you can substitute, for the above, are apricot kernel, grapeseed, sunflower, safflower, or soybean. Rounding out the rest of the ingredients are beeswax, vitamin E, and essential and fragrance oils. Beeswax helps formulations keep their shape, as well as, act as a humectant. Vitamin E oil protects your product from rancidity and is also a great natural antioxidant. Essential oils are natural ingredients that are the very essence of the plant itself. Extracted from the flowers, fruit, leaves, bark, and roots of the plant, the oils are used for scent and therapeutic purposes. A word of caution, due to their volatility, research any essential oil before use. Fragrance oils, though synthetic in nature, do provide an inexpensive and easy way to achieve a scent that might not be possible with essential oils. Ingredients:\n\n3      	"

Change is a constant process and part of being human. When you embark on changing anything in your life you have to start from where you are. Until you know where that is it would be difficult to effectively make the change. You have to start with a baseline.\n\nStarting with a baseline is about honestly figuring out where you are and what you are doing so that you know exactly what needs to be changed. It may sound odd, but many of us are unaware of what we do. When my clients tell me they want to lose weight the first thing I do is have them keep a food journal for a week just to get a baseline. The next week they share how shocked they were to see not only how much they were eating, but also what they were eating. Many of us are on autopilot and we simply are not aware of what we are doing. When you track it – and this works with anything – you have a real picture of where you are and what needs to change.\n\nI read a statistic once that said most people consistently spend about 10% more than they make. I believe that is true, and it is because what is being spent, especially on a credit card, is not tracked. I once had a client that just didn’t have enough time to accomplish everything she needed to do. When she tracked her time for a week she was made painfully aware that she was spending hours in front of the television. The first step in change is awareness. You have to become aware of what you are doing and exactly where you are before you can proceed forward. Keeping track for a week or two will provide you with valuable information that will support your change effort.\n\nBefore you embark on any type of change effort you have to know where you are. I liken it to those travel maps that have an X printed next to “You are here.” Until you are aware of exactly where you are – and many of us don’t have a clue – it will be impossible to make the needed change.\n\nThe first step in your change effort is to determine where you are. Keep a log for a week or two. This will give you a realistic idea of what you are doing. You can track anything from how much money you spend to how many hours of sleep you get. Once you know the truth about where you are you can proceed."},{title:"Hypnosis 6 Secret Tips To Stay Young Forever",body:"We all live in an age that belongs to the young at heart.

Does your group struggle to find ways to help others? Tired of the same old Bake Sale-Car Wash routine?\n\nBelow are five ideas your group can use to make a difference. These come from the e-book, href=”http://www.101WaysSeries.com” target= “_blank”>”101 Ways to Change the World.\n\n1.	Organize a Group or Neighborhood Yard Sale and contribute the proceeds to a worthy cause. One neighborhood adopted an orphanage in Thailand and worked together to send thousands of dollars from their garage sale. In addition to the money they sent, neighbors became closer and new friendships were made.\n\n2.	Organize a Homeless Shelter (or other needy group) Scavenger Hunt. You’ll need a group of people – the more, the better.\n\nCall the Homeless Shelter or group and ask for a list of needs\n\nAsk them to put the things they need most or get the least of, at the top of the list. Assign point values to each item – with the most-needed items getting the most point value.\n\nSend everyone out with their lists – let them know that the team or person that creates the most points with what they bring in, will win the contest. Either put up a prize yourself or ask a local restaurant if they will provide a free meal to the winners.\n\nYounger adults really enjoy the search for items and what a great lesson – it’s fun to give to others!\n\n3.	Have a Toy Drive for a local Battered Women’s Shelter, Safe House or Homeless Shelter that has kids. The toys don’t have to be new. Have members go around their neighborhoods\n\nAsk each family to donate ‘gently used’ toys their kids don’t use anymore. There will be tons – what a great way to involve kids in the joy of giving!\n\n4.	If you play a sport, have your teammates bring in their old equipment. Much of it will still be in good shape. Donate it to a team in a less fortunate part of town\n\nFind a group overseas to receive the equipment for teams in their own country 5.	A group of 50 of classmates went to their Community Center.\n\nThey painted it, fixed the chairs, and basketball hoops. They bought more balls and equipment with money raised from a School Rummage and Bake Sale. They repainted the lines on the courts and planted some flowering plants in the front. A few dads repaired the Jungle Gym, the slide and the swings out back. Then they painted all of them rainbow colors and weeded the back lot.\n\nThey had a lot of fun and made a big difference at the same time! And the children learned the value of caring about others.\n\nRemember, your ability to make a difference depends on your choice to do it. It’s just that simple.

This may even be inside a bus or in your own room. The idea is to be able to concentrate in any environment that you find is suitable. The ideal is to be able to concentrate in any environment that you find is suitable. The ideal time, however, I have found to be is, early in the morning or before going to bed. The ideal place however, may be anywhere as long as you can concentrate.\n\nStep Two: Feel comfortable. Wear loose clothes or else loosen your belt and tie.\n\nStep Three: Be comfortable. Keep your spine straight. Loosen your hands. Relax! This eases your body tension and helps your blood circulate efficiently.\n\nStep Four: Close your eyes. That way your physical world does not interrupt you and you can concentrate on your mental world. But avoid quenching your eyes. Close them gently. In fact, once you focus on your images, you may find your eyes closing naturally.\n\nStep Five: Breathe normally. Let your body roll with the rhythm of your breathing. Listen to that rhythm.\n\nStep Six: Now begin the process of visualization. Create the key images of the subject you have chosen. Form the shape. Add color. Build the sound. Sense them! Focus on them. See them as sharply and clearly as you can with your mind’s eye.\n\nStep Seven: Put yourself in the images you have created. You must be inside the picture so as to let your subconscious mind know that the image you see that leads to your goal is actually meant for you, and not for anyone else.\n\nStep Eight: Feel the image you have created. Now that you are inside the picture imagine yourself to be leading the time you see. Feel the environment. Watch how different it feels to lead a life that you had desired. Bring your images alive.\n\nStep Nine: Experience the images with all your emotions. See! Hear! Smell! Feel how it feels to have achieved your goals. Let the excitement and happiness of success flow through you. Let the thrill of success build in you. Feel your success.\n\nStep Ten: Once you have experienced your images with emotion, let your mind go blank. If you hold on to your images for too long, the images might disappear due to overexposure. So, let go of it.\n\nStep Eleven: Create a space in your mind to receive what you desire. Say to yourself that what you desire – like, “I deserve to be healthy”, “I deserve to be rich and famous.” By doing this, you not only let your subconscious mind support the picture, you literally achieve your success.\n\nStep Twelve: Feel creative while creating the images. I have given you the basic guidelines in the following pages to create visuals that will help you achieve your goals. You may change them accordingly to suit your needs. The more the images meet your specific needs, the more effective they will be.\n\nThese then are the twelve important steps to mind-power. Remember, it is better to visualize 2-3 times a day for a shorter duration than to visualize for a long stretch during the day. Doing this, the quality of visuals remain fresh instead of becoming stale and plaid and draining all energy out of you.\n\nSteps one to ten might take you anything between 5-10 minutes. It is better if you do not prolong it. Instead, repeat it at another time of the day.\n\nWhen you release the image after this brief exercise, your mind will become free of the mind-power you had activated. But your subconscious mind keeps on supporting the image you had seen. This helps your goal and your dreams to be a reality.\n\nThe twelve steps to Mind power that I have explained above is the most powerful tool in this world. When you switch on your mind power and extend it to creative visualization for turning your dreams into reality – then, that is exactly what will happen. Your dreams will become reality.\n\nRemember, with your mind you can rule the world."},{title:"Why Re Invent The Light Bulb",body:"Have you ever had a problem with a burned light? Thanks to the effort of Thomas Edison we no longer need to invent a light bulb. We just go to the store or our cupboard and pull one out and screw it in. Voila! Light!\n\nI am sure you realize that it took Thomas Edison many, many tries before he perfected the light bulb. Someone asked him one day if he grew discouraged by his failures. He answered, “I haven’t failed, I’ve discovered one more way how not to make a light bulb”.\n\nYou see, there is no such thing as failure, there are only results. Someone once said that the definition of Insanity is to do something over and over again and get the same results.\n\nIn order for our life to work properly we need to make some changes to the things we are doing.\n\nJust like a light can burn out, so can we. Life can become dark and depressing and we feel there is no light, no hope in sight. It’s a fairly dismal picture for sure.\n\nLet me shine some light on this situation (pun intended). When we are feeling so low and deep in the pits, this is when we need light to see our way through. Some of us are lucky enough to have some light on hand, others must go out and retrieve it.\n\nMany people try and invent light for themselves by thinking positive thoughts but it only takes them so far. It only gives so much light. There is more light available but people are at a quandary as to how to obtain it.\n\nWe don’t have to be like Thomas Edison and keep looking at the problem and thinking of ways to solve them.\n\nFor every problem there is a Solution.\n\nHow do we find the solution? We can try, as we said, to try and figure it out by ourselves, or we can find someone who has already surpassed this obstacle and do what they did.\n\nThere are many books on the market today that can help us to understand how to overcome the obstacles in our lives. We need to read and learn from the failures of other people. They have been through it all before and can help to teach us how to go through it now. There have been great thinkers in our history and we are fortunate enough to have their trail to follow.\n\nWe all need more light in our life. Sometimes we can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel but there is always hope and help.\n\nLearn how others have overcome their challenges and keep that education inside of you so that when you are feeling low and life looks dim, you can pull out those resources to help you light up your life again.\n\nDon’t try to re-invent the light bulb, Learn how to carry the light within yourselves."},{title:"Mind Power The Ultimate Success Formula",body:"What does it take to be successful? Ask around and you will find different answers to the formula of success. The truth is, success leaves clues and you can achieve the success in the area you desire by observing the common qualities and principles. They are simple and considered to be common sense but most people simply do not follow them.\n\nLet me share with you one of my favorite quotes:\n\n“There are no secrets to success. It is the results of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure” Colin Powell\n\nAs stated in that quote, there are three key factors to achieve massive success in your life:\n\n1.Preparation\n\nYou don’t have to wait for everything to be perfect. Start with the first step and keep moving. Success doesn’t happen over night. Prepare, prepare, and prepare. You must be ready to receive the success you desire. Set your sight to the destination that you want to achieve, then work and prepare for the moment when the opportunity knocks your door.\n\n2.Hard Work\n\nSuccess needs hard work. Don’t listen to these ‘get rich quick’ schemes. You need to build your character and work hard on yourself and your business to achieve greatness. Work hard and work smart. Do the right things and do them in the right way. Don’t procrastinate. Take bold actions. Work long hours and craft your legacy.\n\n3.Learning from failure\n\nSuccessful people do not see failures as failures. They see them as important learning lessons. Lessons that are capable of giving them insights to prevent such mistakes from happening again. By adopting this mindset of turning each failure into a learning lesson or opportunity, you can never fail until you yourself quit.\n\nPreparation, hard work and learning from your failures are the fundamentals to building your bright future."},{title:"Fear Of Driving And Automatic Negative Thoughts",body:"The fear of driving is often complicated, if not caused by, the individuals’ automatic negative thoughts. These thoughts can be scary and irrational, such as the concern that they will veer into oncoming traffic or drive off a bridge, or they may be centered on the person’s physical feelings of anxiety such as a rapid heartbeat or dizziness. These thoughts are often described as the most bothersome symptom of driving anxiety and they can be the actual triggers for panic attacks while driving. Controlling these thoughts is critical to success in eliminating a driving phobia.\n\nThought Stopping\n\nIt is sometimes advised that the individual who has a fear of driving diligently try to stop their negative thoughts. Although this is well intentioned and the goal certainly is to reduce the quantity of these bothersome thoughts, the technique is inherently flawed. Requiring the individual to remember what not to think of infers that they have already thought it. It is akin to telling them to not think of a blue banana. The first thing they will think of is a blue banana because the very act of remembering what not to think of requires the thought that is intended to be avoided. Methods of mentally visualizing a stop sign or snapping oneself with a rubber band to train the mind to no longer have the thoughts is unfortunately an often suggested technique that is not recommended. \n\nScheduled Worry Time\n\nWorry time is setting aside specific periods of time through the day, typically morning and evening, to devote to letting these thoughts run their course. For instance, a common thought associated with the fear of driving is that of being trapped and not being able to escape and losing control. For this thought, the individual would force themselves to ruminate on the thought twice a day for a predefined period of time. The intention is twofold. First, the thought becomes less powerful as the person becomes disinterested in it after repeatedly playing out the scenario mentally. Secondly, the technique teaches the person to be able to postpone their worrying until the designated time, which eventually may allow them to postpone the concern indefinitely. \n\nWe have seen moderate success with this approach for very isolated thoughts or specific driving fears. For instance, if there is a particular bridge that is bothersome, but not bridges in general. For the overall fear of driving, there are too many fearful thoughts to effectively use this technique for long term. It also does not foster the acceptance and understanding of the fearful thoughts and sensations that is so critical for success. \n\nCreative Visualization\n\nThe vast majority of those with irrational, compulsive, and scary thoughts associated with a fear of driving are highly intelligent and creative people. Many of the bothersome thoughts they have are not based on historical evidence or fact (they have likely never responded in the manner they fear, yet the fear remains), and are created by their overactive creative imagination. These abilities allow the phobic person to play out situations in the mind very convincingly and this realism helps to perpetuate the fear. The Driving Fear program, which specialized in the treatment of driving phobias and anxiety has developed a technique which uses these creative skills to eliminate instead of perpetuate the bothersome thoughts. It actually allows the same traits which created the fear to end the fear."},{title:"Motivational Sayings Ten Great Ones",body:"Why read motivational sayings? For motivation! You might need a bit, if you can use last year’s list of goals this year because it’s as good as new. All of us can benefit from inspirational thoughts, so here are ten great ones.\n\n“Be more concerned with your character than with your reputation. Your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are.” – Dale Carnegie\n\n“Do not wait; the time will never be ‘just right.’ Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.” – Napoleon Hill\n\n“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n“Some men see things as they are and say, “Why?” I dream of things that never were and say, “Why not?” – George Bernard Shaw\n\n“A small trouble is like a pebble. Hold it too close to your eye and it fills the whole world and puts everything out of focus. Hold it at a proper distance and it can be examined and properly classified. Throw it at your feet and it can be seen in its true setting, just one more tiny bump on the pathway of life.” – Celia Luce “Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.” – Carl Bard “I’m not telling you it is going to be easy – I’m telling you it’s going to be worth it” – Art Williams Motivational Sayings – Attitude\n\nAttitude “There is little difference in people, but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.” – W. Clement Stone\n\n“Nothing on earth can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” – Thomas Jefferson “A person cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.” – James Allen\n\n“Man often becomes what he believes himself to be.

Hopefully one or two of them are also inspiring to you. If not, maybe they will motivate you to create your own motivational sayings."},{title:"Hypnosis Quit Smoking Techniques",body:"It is very easy to start smoking but it is an uphill task to quit it. Ask any chain smoker or even a person who smokes just a few cigarettes everyday. Usually a person can stop smoking for a couple of days, then the urge to smoke is so strong that one makes all kinds of excuses to start it again. So you are back to square one. All kinds of methods have been advocated for quitting smoking, but the one that has made a big impact is Hypnosis. Hypnosis quit smoking methods has divided the medical fraternity into two. While some argue that Hypnosis quit smoking methods are not effective in the long run, there are others who advocate quitting smoking using hypnosis. They feel that hypnosis for quitting smoking is as effective as products that help one stop smoking.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how long you have been smoking, whether you are a social smoker or a chain smoker if you want to quit smoking then hypnosis can help you. Everyone who has tried to quit smoking knows about the mood swings, lethargy and the intense cravings. When you use hypnosis to help you stop smoking, you have the help of a hypnotherapist who slowly takes you into a dreamlike state. You relax from head to toe. During this period a person is very receptive to suggestions. The hypnotherapist would then use many positive suggestions that would help a patient to cut down his cravings for cigarettes. This is because one is in a relaxed state after hypnosis, therefore one feels less stress. And when one is less stressed one doesn’t have the urge to smoke. There has been a lot of debate on whether hypnosis quit smoking methods work in the long run. Some people are of the opinion that during the period of hypnosis treatment the patient is able to control his urge to smoke, but the moment the treatment is over they cannot control the urge to smoke. In spite of this hypnosis is still one of the most popular methods to help one quit smoking. In the USA there are quite a few clinics that help one to quit smoking using hypnosis. For example Iowa and Indiana have a number of such clinics.  But the most important thing that you must remember when you want to quit smoking is that any method, whether it is hypnosis quit smoking methods or any other methods will work only if you have the willpower to say no to cigarettes.

},{title:"Hypnosis And Nlp In The Management Of Pain",body:"Pain can be defined quite simply as a symptom of some physical hurt or disorder, an affliction or an emotional distress. Mild pain can be treated in many ways … over the counter drugs and balms. But what if the pain is chronic and unbearable? Well we get prescription drugs. Most of the drugs work well, but for some people with severe or chronic pain, NLP and hypnosis works wonders.\n\nWhat is NLP? It is neuro-linguistic programming. NLP uses a set of models and principles to describe the relationship between mind and language. Though initially dubious about the treatment of pain with hypnosis, the medical community are now of the opinion that hypnosis does indeed help in controlling pain.\n\nAcute pain lasts for a short while chronic pain lasts for a long time, usually more than a month. Even mild low – level pain can be debilitating. Pain comes in many forms, jabbing, throbbing stabbing, nagging etc. Pain is also influenced by various factors like memory, emotions and physical condition of each individual. Another perplexing complication is that sometimes pain has no organic cause at all.\n\nPain has sometimes been described as past remembered pain, present pain experience and also anticipated pain in the future. The combination of these three often gives us the meaning of pain and this is one of the reasons why chronic pain is almost always so debilitating. What increases the pain is the expectation that the pain will be there the next day, and the day after and the day after and so on.\n\nA few of the techniques that help us deal with pain are given below\n\nTrance and Relaxation are the easiest things that one can do relax. The way to relax is simple. All you have to do is tell yourself in a deep and gentle tone take a deep breathe and relax. With each breath you must relax further. Tell yourself that as you count down from 5 to1 you will relax still further till you are in a trance.\n\nSynesthesia is a technique that is best done in a light trance. In this technique you explore the pain as a sensation. What exactly is the pain? Where is it, is it a slow or a fast moving pain? Does it have any color and texture? How does it move? This might seem difficult but don’t worry. The important thing is to try and put some meaning to your pain, give it shape so that it makes some sense to your unconscious mind. What you have to do next is to think that the pain is outside your body where it is easier to observe. Try and examine it a little away from you say at a distance of about two meters. Now what you can do is to change the quality of pain. Make it smaller or bigger or change the color and the sound. Change the way it moves. Now observe what happens when you cause changes in the pain. When you are finally satisfied with the changes that you have made in your pain you can send the whole pain to a far away place or you can even put it back into your own body but in a different location where the pain can be more manageable. Or even better, you can just turn your pain up side down and put it back in the same place so that it cancels out the original pain.  \n\nIncreasing Your Energy  \n\nPain can be very debilitating and saps us of our energy. But we can overcome this by practicing some very simple visualization exercises. Bring yourself to a point of total relaxation and focus on breathing. Imagine golden ball of light all around your body, which you can hear, as well as feel vibrating. Then imagine that when you breathe in you are taking in energy. The golden light now becomes brighter and brighter, the harmonies get louder and the vibrations become stronger and stronger. As you breathe out imagine that all the tension and pain are expelled from your body. Now the vibrations and harmonies become a tool to help you relax further and you can feel the sensations massaging your body. With the help of the techniques mentioned above you can help yourself in taking control of your pain. But remember that they are not hypnosis or NLP techniques. Love and good wishes,"},{title:"Benjamin Franklin S Method Of Habit Formation",body:"Benjamin Franklin, inventor, statesman, writer, publisher and economist relates in his autobiography that early in his life he decided to focus on arriving at moral perfection. He made a list of 13 virtues, assigning a page to each. Under each virtue he wrote a summary that gave it fuller meaning. Then he practiced each one for a certain length of time. To make these virtues a habit, Franklin can up with a method to grade himself on his daily actions. In a journal he drew a table with a row for every virtue and a column for every day of the week. Every time he made a fault, he made a mark in the appropriate column. Each week he focused his attention on a different virtue. Over time, through repetition, he hoped to one day experience the pleasure of “viewing a clean Book.” He says that he carried out this personal examination for years. In order to do the work thoroughly he decided to attempt each virtue and a quarter of its importance – one at a time. He began with temperance, which included the moderating of every pleasure or inclination to develop undesirable habits, because temperance “tends to procure that coolness and clearance and head that is so necessary where constant vigilance is to be kept up and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations.”\n\nThe other virtues practice in succession by Franklin were silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, Justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity and humility. For the summary order he followed a little scheme of employing his time each day. From five to seven each morning he spent in bodily personal attention, saying a short prayer, thinking over the day’s business and resolutions, studying and eating breakfast. From eight till twelve he worked at his trade. From twelve to one he read or overlooked his accounts and dined. From two to five he worked at his trade. The rest of the evening until 10 he spent in music, or diversion of some sort. This time is used also to put things in their places. In the last thing before retiring was examination of the day. At the age of 79, he ascribed his health to temperance; the acquisition of misfortune to industry and frugality; the confidence of his country to sincerity and justice.\n\nFranklin’s extraordinary success in life and politics can be attributed to his perseverance to overcome his personal liabilities, and his desire to constantly become better. Next time you really want to achieve something, take time to focus on your own personal journal. What is your temptation that is standing in your way to greatness? What can you do to form the habit of becoming a success?"},{title:"Motivation And Your Personal Vision An Unbeatable Force",body:"Motivation can take you far, but it can take you even further if you first find your vision. Your vision will motivate and guide you on your journey to success and personal fullfillment. Trying to succeed at anything without first having a clear vision of what it is you want to accomplish will only lead to you going around in circles and eventually giving up in frustration.  To develop your vision, you must look inside yourself. Vision comes from within, from the spirit or subconscious, whatever you choose to call it. Every one has a vision that is uniquely their own, and you are no different. the hard part comes in understanding your personal vision and how it applies to your personal motivation plan.  Your vision will most likely not come suddenly like some bolt of lightning out of the sky. Instead, it will grow from your experiences, talents, dreams, and desires, so don’t try to rush it. Instead, keep your motivation and allow your vision to reveal itself through you.  Here are five steps you can use to effectively find your vision:  1. Learn to listen to your inner voice. Since your vision starts from inside you, you should learn to listen and feel what your mind and heart truly desire. What stirs you? What is your greatest desire? What kind of dreams do you have? If what you think you want does not really come from the inner depths of your heart and soul, then you will find it difficult, if not impossible, to not give up before you achieve it.  2. Prepare yourself mentally. Your vision begins in your mind and heart. It is something that burns within your soul. it should be greater than your all of your past memories, mistakes, and accomplishments. If you know what your vision is, you will have a purpose and won’t get lost on your journey. Discouragement is the outcome of not having a ditinct vision. If you don’t know where you’re going or how to get there, the journey will seem a lot longer and harder.  In order to seek your vision, retreat to a quiet and tranquil place, a place that will allow your mind to think creatively and concentrate on your vision.  3. Seek out other motivated vision seekers. Greatness breeds greatness, and it is for this reason that you should seek out the company of others who can appreciate and support your vision. Hang with the winners and it will keep your motivation high.  4. Keep a notebook and pen handy. All too often, when seeking a vision, it is easy to forget that it is 90 percent inspiration, as American inventor Thomas Edison said. With that in mind, you never know when your vision is going to come to fruition, so keep a small notebook with you at all times, even on your nightstand when you sleep, and write down whatever comes to mind, no matter how silly it seems at the time. You may write down a hundred crazy ideas but number one hundred and one just might be the vision you were searching for. Don’t try to edit right now, just write down everything that comes to mind.   5. Don’t try to fully understand your vision. The vision you are seeking will most likely come to you in ways that you won’t fully understand at the moment. That’s okay. Just follow as much of your vision as you can right now, and more will be revealed to you as time goes on.   All truly successful people have a vision that they follow, no matter what challenges they may face, to it’s eventual outcome. Begin following the above steps to seek your vision today and remember that true, lasting success will never come to you until you know what your vision is and how you will follow it. And you will be unstoppable if you combine your personal vision with a healthy dose of motivation."},{title:"How To Set Intentions That Energize You",body:"We’ve all heard how crucial it is to set intentions, goals and targets. Powerful goals electrify us. Clear intentions energize and pull us forward.\n\nWithout a clearcut intention, we’re reactive and don’t get around to doing the important things when we want them done. Instead, we spend our time fighting random fires.\n\nWithout clear intentions, anything might happen. And usually does.\n\nLiterally, intentions are like the steering wheel on your car. Their whole purpose is to give you control over where you’re going. But when setting intentions or goals, keep in mind that if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.\n\nNow, it’s good to have intentions at more than one level. When we get up into the more conceptual intentions, such as “I will contribute to the wellbeing of those around me,” these become like a mission statement.\n\nBut then, be sure you move on to decide specifically how you will go about implementing your mission in your daily life. Specifics are essential. How — specifically — will you put your mission into action today? What will you actually DO about your highest intentions? It’s important to set intentions for yourself because this is where the rubber meets the road. Just say “I’m going to do this and this.” It should be nothing big and overpowering. Just some stuff you’re meaning to do or achieve short-term. Be sure to write them down on paper. When you list them out, you can clearly look over your results afterward and check yourself. At the end of today or this time next week, did you do what you said you’d do? Expressed like that, it’s clear that we’re building a kind of internal integrity check within ourselves.\n\nWhen you’re first starting to build this new intention-setting skill (habit), it’s important not to pile on too much. Sure, it’s easy to get all excited about turning over a new leaf, but it’s essential that you start where you are NOW, not where you think you SHOULD be. There are things that, from experience, you already know you can do. Set your intentions to do those things (plus perhaps a little bit more) and achieve them. Then, when you’re comfortable doing what you say you’ll do, then you can begin to stretch your intention muscles a little more. But as in any new regimin, begin easy. Begin with what you can actually do. And only after you get comfortable with the intention-setting process should you start going for real growth.

Most often, it is the opinions of total strangers that breeds the most negativity as if someone who doesn’t know or understand you is able to voice a reasonably thought out opinion about you. No, you shouldn’t avoid those who are close to you, rather there are areas of conversation that are less profitable. Accept criticism constructively, but steer the conversation away from nonstop negative banter. Negativity will grow on you unless you take control.\n\n2. Build Yourself Up. No, I do not mean for you to puff yourself up with pride, rather you can be your best source of encouragement by encouraging yourself. How can you do this? Read the testimonies of other entrepreneurs/succeeders who have gone before you. Current day success stories of people who have gone from “rags to riches” [or from simple means to great influence] include personalities like Oprah Winfrey, Martha Stewart, and Bill Gates. Yesterday’s success stories are numerous and include: Thomas Edison, Harry S. Truman, and Abraham Lincoln.\n\n3. Go Back to Square One. Should you find yourself wavering, recall those things that encouraged you to take your “step of faith” in the first place. Recall what it takes to succeed: discipline, self confidence, independence, hard work, sacrifice, etc. Look forward to the anticipated results: a good income, independence, a job you love, etc. Finally, remember the worst job you ever worked…imagine yourself working there again. Blah! Use whatever it takes to motivate you.\n\nSo, toss off the negative thoughts and embrace that which is uplifting, inspiring, encouraging, warm, friendly, and helpful. You are on track to achieving great things as long as you do not let yourself become derailed by the negative words of others."},{title:"Know Yourself Your Inner Power",body:"I am upset.

All of this is confusing. It’s a form of madness (no offence intended). I think what’s worse is that it is quite normal for most people. \n\nSo, as I sit here and stew, let us see if we can work this all out. Where does all this negative emotion come from? Well, obviously from the thing that was said to me. The person I had the “conversation” with spoke words. These words were taken by my mind, analysed, and a proper “reaction” was produced based on the result of the analysis. No matter how deep we go into human psychology and the workings of the mind; that really is the simple description of what happened. That’s all we need to concern ourselves with. We can keep it simple, and then try a simple approach to addressing the problem. The problem is whatever the person said. Words…Just words. How can words have such a powerful effect? The answer is that they don’t. What has the effect is the power we give those words…our rating of them…our belief in them. So if someone calls you an idiot, you might be offended. Why? I mean you know you are not an idiot. Most likely the person knows it too. Why the negative response? Why can’t you ignore it? Well, because you are wired that way. You can’t stand to see that anyone would say you were an idiot. It is not enough that you know you’re not an idiot. You need this person to acknowledge that as well. And what’s wrong with that? I think it’s natural for us to want other people recognize the message we are trying to convey by our words or actions (whether or not the message is true or false). Sadly, no matter what we do, there are people who will always interpret things how they choose. Basically, no matter how much you show James how much of a genius you are, James (Sorry if your name is James) will still call you an idiot, and probably feel he is better than you.\n\nIt’s absurd! James isn’t better than you are. No one is. You have to remember that. Know thyself. Derive your strength from that. What do you do about those who refuse to accept your side of the story? Leave them. Ignore them. Walk away after putting your point across. But don’t get drawn in. I am not going to get overly religious on you, but I want to make a point. Jesus Christ said “Turn the other cheek”. I think people misinterpret that as a sign of passivity; of a desire to avoid confrontation; even of weakness. I disagree. I think it is an act of someone who is so powerfully aware of their own inner strength and value that they there is nothing you could do to take that away. Abuse me, torture me and kill me, yes. But you will never change the truth. People who can deal with the hurtful utterances of others go very far because they don’t allow these words get to them. Put in another way, sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me. There’s a bit missing there. That bit is “…unless I allow them”. It’s in your power to choose your reaction to what others say or do. Believe in yourself, first and foremost.

This article will show you how to take the negative influences in your life away and replace them with positives, so you will have increases in morale, and productivity. Focus on the positive for success and peak performance. Most of us are not aware of the amount of negative influences in our lives. We are bombarded with negative messages from the media, the people around us, and most damaging of all, ourselves.\n\nThe first step in the process in replacing negatives with positives in your life is to make a decision to start looking for the negative messages and ways to replace them with positives. Decide that you will focus on the positive in this world. \n\nBegin to drastically cut down on the amount of news you take in. Most people start their day with the news. And of course most of the news is bad news, fires, floods, etc. Then it is on to traffic and weather, which also stresses the negatives. So by the time you have finished your coffee, you have had enough bad news to last a week. Does all this bad news make you want to throw open the door and greet the new days, no quite the opposite. And how about the way we end the day? Many of us watch the news before going to bed and get a big dose of negative information just before trying to go to sleep. Is it any wonder so many people have trouble sleeping? The mood we are in before we go to sleep carries over to the next morning, so you are setting yourself up for starting the next day in a bad mood. Odds are you don’t need all that negative information you are taking in from the news, and you will function just fine without it. \n\nReplace the news you were taking in with such things as, motivational tapes, uplifting music and sites such as happynews.com, that stress good news. Also reading empowering books helps a great deal. Books can be a fantastic way to recharge your life. Look for success stories, biographies of successful people, etc and see what works for you. You will begin to feel better right away.\n\nYour next step is to limit the amount of TV you watch. A recent study showed that 78% of the people watching TV, are not interested in the program they are watching at any given time. So watching TV is probably making you bored at best, and taking you away from actives that would be more fun. Prime time is the period when most people are watching TV; you can make it your prime time by turning off the TV and using that time to move your life ahead. Next you need to limit your exposure to negative people. Most people don’t realize how draining it is to be around negative people, but they drain your energy and spirit in many ways. Negative people pull you down, so work to remove them from your life to the extent you can. Never get involved in the office pity party, or complaint sessions that come your way.  Seek out people that support you and that you feel good being around and use these people to replace the negative people in your life.  The most damaging source of negativity is ourselves. Most of us generate lots of negative self talk that our minds accept as the truth and results in our being held back in many ways. We focus on our shortcomings, our problems, and spend our time predicting more bad news for ourselves, generating lots of fear and worry, while undercutting our ability to try new things, etc. Begin to focus on the positive aspects of you. What are your unique strengths, what have you accomplished, how are you different and better than other people? Use visualization and affirmations to build images of yourself accomplishing the things you want and use these to replace the negative images. Give yourself lots of credit for everything you do right, so you are getting even more positive news about yourself. Also, set aside three minutes every day to think about all the good things you have in your life right now. The process of thinking of the good things in your life, will generate good feelings for you that will last much of the day. Don’t forget to take care of your body. Eat healthy, cut out some bad habits, and get regular exercise in order to boost your self-esteem while building your strength and endurance, so you can accomplish more.  Helping others will also help you feel better about yourself. Take time to get involved in a charity, animal shelter, or other activates that help others. You will get good feedback from others and develop a genuine sense that you are a good person. What you put out comes back to you, so make sure it is good that goes out. By replacing the negatives in your life, with positives, you will make yourself and probably the world a better place. You will feel better mentally and physically, plus accomplish many of the things you wanted to. Nothing is ever accomplished without action, so start now to move your life ahead."

"},{title:"The Power Of Notes",body:"Notes are very powerful. They express your thanks, encouragement, sympathy, apology, congratulations, feelings, and requests to others.\n\nMany people create notes on a computer and print them or send them through the Internet. However, I believe the most effective notes are handwritten. A handwritten note is personal and rare. Due to this, it will be given more attention by the reader and have maximum impact.\n\nA few weeks ago I was in Michigan for my dad’s funeral. While there I attended my mom’s church on Sunday and met her pastor for the second time. While talking to him, I learned that his mother died a few months ago and his dad was critically ill. On my way home to Virginia, I had a stop at Chicago O’Hare Airport. While waiting for my connecting flight, I pulled out a box of note cards and wrote several notes and mailed them. One of those was an encouraging note to my mom’s pastor. I found out later that he was so touched by the note that he took it to his church and read it at a meeting. He made it clear to those in attendance how much of an encouragement it was to him. What I didn’t know when I wrote the note was that during the following week not only did his dad pass away but his wife was diagnosed with cancer. I believe God used my note to help him during a very difficult time in his life. I also wonder how many others he talked to were changed because of that note. Maybe some of them are now writing notes as well. What if I hadn’t written that note?\n\nI would encourage you to start writing notes regularly. What a simple way to influence people’s lives in a positive way. If you are concerned about how to get started, the following two books on the subject have been the most useful to me:\n\n– “The Art of the Handwritten Note: A Guide to Reclaiming Civilized Communication” by Margaret Shepherd\n\n– “Business Notes: Writing Personal Notes That Build Professional Relationships” by Florence Isaacs Get a note card, pen and stamp. Write a note to someone who has been on your mind today. Only God knows how much that person, and the world, will change for the better due to the few minutes you take out of your busy schedule to write a few sentences."},{title:"How To Set Intentions That Energize You",body:"We’ve all heard how crucial it is to set intentions, goals and targets. Powerful goals electrify us. Clear intentions energize and pull us forward.\n\nWithout a clearcut intention, we’re reactive and don’t get around to doing the important things when we want them done. Instead, we spend our time fighting random fires.\n\nWithout clear intentions, anything might happen. And usually does.\n\nLiterally, intentions are like the steering wheel on your car. Their whole purpose is to give you control over where you’re going. But when setting intentions or goals, keep in mind that if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.\n\nNow, it’s good to have intentions at more than one level. When we get up into the more conceptual intentions, such as “I will contribute to the wellbeing of those around me,” these become like a mission statement.\n\nBut then, be sure you move on to decide specifically how you will go about implementing your mission in your daily life. Specifics are essential. How — specifically — will you put your mission into action today? What will you actually DO about your highest intentions? It’s important to set intentions for yourself because this is where the rubber meets the road. Just say “I’m going to do this and this.” It should be nothing big and overpowering. Just some stuff you’re meaning to do or achieve short-term. Be sure to write them down on paper. When you list them out, you can clearly look over your results afterward and check yourself. At the end of today or this time next week, did you do what you said you’d do? Expressed like that, it’s clear that we’re building a kind of internal integrity check within ourselves.\n\nWhen you’re first starting to build this new intention-setting skill (habit), it’s important not to pile on too much. Sure, it’s easy to get all excited about turning over a new leaf, but it’s essential that you start where you are NOW, not where you think you SHOULD be. There are things that, from experience, you already know you can do. Set your intentions to do those things (plus perhaps a little bit more) and achieve them. Then, when you’re comfortable doing what you say you’ll do, then you can begin to stretch your intention muscles a little more. But as in any new regimin, begin easy. Begin with what you can actually do. And only after you get comfortable with the intention-setting process should you start going for real growth. Patience – taking small, measured steps – is more than a virtue here. It’s the key to keeping yourself moving forward. (Notice I said patience, not procrastination.) Attempt too much too soon, and the end result will be another round of demotivation and discouragement.\n\nInstead, go about this logically and gradually: keep your eye on the level you want to reach next year, and let today’s effort take you 1/365th of the way there.

Many employers will add these quotes inside the employees’ paycheck envelope. Sometimes it may be a motivational quote, other times a silly antidote.

Pick a topic-love, friendship, careers, etc. The list of issues that people complain about is endless. You and I are no different. Perhaps we don’t complain about each of these things but more than likely there is something that we complain about with great regularity.\n\nNow, sometimes complaints are simply a way to vent some frustration at the moment but we don’t really want anything to change in this area. However, more often than not, someone regularly complains about one specific problem\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I heard one friend complain about the difficulty of finding a good man I could throw her a huge wedding bash or perhaps simply buy her a husband in some small third-world country. When I thought about my friend Donna’s problem and applied Seneca’s quote to it a light bulb suddenly appeared above my head just like in the cartoons!\n\nIt was true! Donna is having difficulty finding a good man simply because she isn’t daring enough. Sure she goes out on dates and tries to maintain an active social life, however she holds herself aloof emotionally. She isn’t willing to dare much at all when it comes to her heart-so how can she hope that someone else will do so for her? Sure, there might be someone, somewhere, but she is also missing out on relationships, at least friendships, with some really great guys simply because she is too afraid to dare to care.\n\nThat is sad. We all know that love is marvelous but it is also frightening, however we have to take risks in order to experience it fully. Sometimes we might get hurt however more often than not we will find the rewards outweigh the risks. There is no guarantee that is Donna opens herself up and dares to love that she will find the love of her life-however there is certainly a guarantee that a life filled with love is more rewarding than one that is not.\n\nI have another friend who is also afraid to dare. Jeff hates his job. No, that’s not exactly right. He loves the work itself but he really hates the company that he works for. He finds the management very difficult to work for (and if even a small percentage of the stories he tells are true then he’s right, it is a horrible place to work).\n\nHowever, every time I suggest he look for a job somewhere else he comes up with some excuse about how difficult it would be. True the job market isn’t great, but he’s a skilled worker in a high-demand field so I’m sure he could find something. He’s doomed his job search before he even started it because he’s not daring enough.\n\nIt wouldn’t be fair to share my friends’ examples without pointing to my own shortcomings. Probably the greatest difficulty in my own life is within my marriage and that is simply because I don’t dare enough emotionally there. I have become too complaisant and take my husband and marriage for granted. I need to dare more emotionally.\n\nSo think about the difficulties in your own life and apply Seneca’s rule then decide if you can be more daring! All the best!"},{title:"Do Your Self Realizations Quickly Fade",body:"As we grow, we do so in fits and starts, lurching forward then back, sometimes looking more like clowns than seekers.\n\nWinston Churchill wrote: “Man will occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of the time he will pick himself up and continue on as though nothing has happened.” We humans, in searching for success and happiness, have several great loves. One is the love of discovering new things. New places… new people… new ideas… they fascinate us. We also love finding new ways to solve problems. If we’ve been suffering the indignities and inconveniences of a long-standing problem, we have an unquenchable urge to find what’s causing the discomfort and fix it. Unfortunately, an equally strong drive within our psyche is the compulsion to keep things from changing. We love variety and change, but we also love predictability. When things start shifting in our world, we get uncomfortable; uncertain; unsure what to do next. So with our left foot we strike out to seek change, while at the same time our right foot drags along behind us, trying with all its might to remain planted in one spot. Often, as Churchill points out, we unquestioningly follow that urge to maintain status quo. Why? Well, it’s the same reason we continue to do anything automatically — habit. Then how do we break the grip of habit? How do we escape the gravity well of inertia? It’s the same way we change any habit. First step: become acutely aware of what we’re doing. No habit can operate properly when we draw back the curtains of inattention. Have you had a realization about yourself or the way you live your life? Maybe you don’t want to let it drift away and become lost to you, the same way countless realizations have done before. Then make a big production of it. Fasten your attention on it. Roll it around in your mind, play with it and explore the implications. Don’t let old habits rob you of the treasure you’ve found. And that’s exactly how you can stop yourself from stumbling over a truth and then continuing on as though it never happened."},{title:"Are You Famous Or Focused",body:"ARE YOU FAMOUS OR FOCUSED?

Both resumes and Motivation Letters are much less formal than their United States equivalents. The Motivation Letter, as its name implies, tells your prospective employers why you are motivated to work for their companies. It gives you a chance to describe your personality, the languages you speak, any awards you may have won, and what motivates you to work abroad.\n\nThe Motivation Letter is constructed like a formal business letter, with your name and address in the top right corner. Beneath this and against the left margin should be the name, job title, company and address of the recipient. (It is worth doing a little digging to find out the name, if you don’t know it.) European countries don’t put a period after title abbreviations, so remember to leave them off ; i.e., “Mr” instead of “Mr.” and “Dr” rather than “Dr.”. Spell out the name of the month and use the order “day-month-year.” \n\nThe first paragraph of your Motivation Letter describes the job for which you are applying, and how you learned about it. The second paragraph should address your qualifications for the job; don’t just list them, talk about them. Show yourself to be a person of initiative and creativity ; in short, motivated! In the third paragraph, talk about why you want this particular job. What skills do you bring to it? What do you hope to learn?

It appears when we least expect it, never letting us prepare for the battle. It hides around corners, waiting to pounce on us. It is constantly testing our inner powers and strength.\n\nTo live is to survive and without survival you have no life. Survival is a choice. If you choose to survive, you must fight hard. If you choose to not survive, you will die. Simple! Survival will change who you are many times. How you deal with your challenge and how drastic the challenge is will determine how much of yourself you manage to keep safe. A couple of common phrases that we run into many times in our day is, “Only the strong survive” and, “What does not kill us will only make us stronger”. These are very good survival attitudes to practice. We need to be strong to survive. It takes pure GUTS to survive and move forward in any situation. It takes having total control of your thoughts, which is one of your best weapons in the battle of survival. It demands consistent striving to reach your goals, stopping at nothing to meet your destiny. \n\nI emphasize the importance of strength, when battling the war of survival.\n\nTo be strong is:\n\nto be able to stand your ground and hold onto your inner beliefs, which will be your best strategy to win the game.\n\nto be born into the survival game without knowledge or understanding of the rules, and still overcome all the obstacles.\n\nto be able to clean the skeletons out of your closet that have been haunting you from your past.\n\nto take control of your life and deal with the monsters, whether it be through telling a story or confronting the monster face to face.\n\nto be able to look back at the reasons for your pain and suffering and wave at it as if it were just a car going by.\n\nto be able to smile at a happy memory of a loved one that was taken from you without reason.\n\nto be able to say NO to drugs and misuse of alcohol.\n\nto be able to forgive, forget and let the waters flow under the bridge.\n\nto feel physical pain every minute you are awake, yet be able to smile and ease that pain with positive thoughts.\n\nto look in the mirror and know you are the best, and to believe who you are.\n\nto let go of hate and resentment, when your heart has been deceived or broken.\n\nto push forward when all the negative forces feel like they are pushing you backwards.\n\nto continue tearing down walls of negative thinking, and replace them with positive openness.\n\nto open your heart to another after it was forced to close.\n\nto keep searching for answers to a better you, even when all you want to do is quit.\n\nto look to tomorrow for the sunshine, when the rain refuses to stop.\n\nto give birth to a child, and raise him/her with love and respect.\n\nto embrace growing old and never regretting it.\n\nto study hard and achieve all the knowledge that the world has to offer you.\n\nto not allow the material world to confuse you as to what is really important in life\n\nto be a hugger, not a judger.\n\nto smile when you want to cry.\n\nto Live, Love and Laugh.\n\n********************************************************\n\n“We are driven by five genetic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun.”\n\nWilliam Glasser  “Love and kindness are the very basis of society.

},{title:"Little Things Do Make A Difference",body:"Think back over your life. Think about the people that had a positive influence on you. If your past was like mine, many of them didn’t realize the impact they made. The influence was usually due to them caring about you and doing some little thing. What little things have been done for you that changed your life? What little things have you done for someone else that might have changed theirs?\n\nI have been influenced by little things done by others.\n\nI had a boss that asked whether I had the guts to take a job he felt I could do. It was a job I wasn’t even qualified to apply for. That question influenced me to set my career goals at a higher level and faster pace than they were at that time.\n\nWhen I attended my first Toastmasters meeting the group made me feel welcome from the moment I set foot in the room. One person made it a point to introduce me to several members before the first meeting started. Another leaned over to me on my second visit, just before my first speech, to let me know what to expect and to let me know I would do great. I am grateful to both of them.\n\nChildren can influence us as well. A great example of this happened to me at a Cub Scout summer camp here in my hometown of Fredericksburg, Virginia. For those of you who are not familiar with Cub Scouts, the boys range from 1st through 5th grade. I showed up on the morning of the first day of camp just to make sure everything went smooth for our group. We got everyone registered for the week’s events, set up a canopy where the scouts and leaders could get under some shade for lunch and then headed to the flagpole. At the flagpole, all of the camp participants said the Pledge of Allegiance and then the camp leader started to give instructions. In the middle of the instructions, one of the 1st grade boys tugged on my pant leg. When I looked down at him, he had the biggest smile on his face. He said, “Mr. Carr, I’m having a really good time” and he meant it! They hadn’t even started their first camp activity yet. At that moment, I knew all of the hours I put in as a scout leader were well worth it.\n\nI have found that we can influence others by doing little things for them.\n\nYou can influence others by providing help when it is needed. When I say provide help, I am not just talking about offering to help. Most people will not take you up on an offer even if they desperately need it. I remember taking food to a couple that was sick. This was not anyone I knew. It was a friend of someone that was in my Sunday school class. Two years later they saw me, thanked me and told me how much that meant to them. They even remembered my name after two years! Another way I have helped was to provide advice to coworkers that now refer to me as their mentor. Also, to help families pack up a truck to move. Some of these families are friends of ours today even though they live several states away.\n\nAnother way I have found that you can influence others is by saying “thank you.” I don’t think I ever realized the power of saying thank you until a few months ago. I was at a professional symposium in Northern Virginia. I was one of the symposium leaders. During a lunch break, I stayed in the room where one of the classes was being given to watch all of the personal belongings of the students while they were at lunch. During the break, three of the hotel workers came into the room to fill water pitchers and put out clean glasses. One of the workers was obviously a mentally challenged person that was hired to help. His job was to put the clean glasses on the tables. When he serviced the table I was sitting at I said a simple “thank you.” I will never forget the look on his face. I could have told him he won the lottery and he couldn’t have looked any more excited! Even after they left the room to go to the next, I could still hear him shouting as loud as he could about the “nice man.”\n\nWriting notes is a third way you can potentially influence others. I started writing thank you notes a couple of years ago (for reasons other than receiving a gift). I have been thanked over and over for some of these notes of appreciation and told I didn’t have to do that. I have recently learned and started using at times a new way of writing notes. I learned it from Charlie “Tremendous” Jones who has since encouraged me to pass this method along to others. Purchase some inexpensive, inspirational books that have had a positive impact on you. Write an encouraging note inside the cover of one of those books and give it to the person. You will feel good doing it, reading the book will change the person, and they will think of you every time they read it. What a powerful gesture!\n\nStart today doing little things for others.\n\nI can look back over my past and remember several moments in time that God used someone doing a little thing that encouraged me. I have also heard from others that have been influenced by me for doing the same. There are many kinds of little things you can do to encourage others. Some of these involve providing help when there is a need, saying thank you, and writing notes. What are you going to do today for someone that will make a difference in his or her life?"},{title:"Helen Keller A Teller And A Seller",body:"What are the odds of someone doing extraordinary things if that person lost their sight, hearing and speech at nineteen months of age? Helen Keller overcame enormous disadvantages to influence the world. Although her teacher and mentor, Anne Sullivan, achieved great results with her, ultimately, Keller’s success was up to Keller.\n\nHow many of you feel sorry for yourselves because you can’t do something? Keller had so many reasons to wallow in self-pity. She was born in the late nineteenth century and did not have the technical advantages that physically-challenged people now have. Keller made the most out of her situation.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of how Keller succeeded:\n\n1. As a little girl, Keller said, “Someday, I shall go to college.”\n\nKeller received her Bachelor of Arts degree cum laude in 1904 from Radcliffe College. How many of you have been persistent enough to earn a bachelor’s degree? Congratulations to those who have earned a Bachelor’s degree, like Keller did. If you earned your degree, you could have given plenty of reasons to have given up on earning your degree. What was Keller’s excuse? She didn’t have an excuse! Keller, blind and deaf, graduated cum laude.\n\n2. Keller wrote about a dozen books\n\nSome of Keller’s published works include The World I Live In; The Song of the Stone Wall; Out of the Dark; My Religion; Midstream–My Later Life; Peace at Eventide; Helen Keller in Scotland; Helen Keller’s Journal; Let Us Have Faith; Teacher, Anne Sullivan Macy; and The Open Door.\n\nThere are many current and aspiring writers who are struggling to finish just one book. Keller’s works inspired many people because of her major disabilities. How many people can you inspire through your written works? Every one of you has a unique story to tell and it’s waiting to be read.\n\nMost of your five senses are operational. Keller only had three operational senses. She learned to speak at age nine with help from Anne Sullivan. Keller’s determination to avoid major obstacles to deter her is one of the most inspiring things about her. The next time we are having it rough, think about how rough a deal Keller had and all of the accomplishments she had."},{title:"Roar With Confidence",body:"I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as good for all of you.\n\nWell I will start this article out by telling you that I did ROAR with CONFIDENCE when I was on vacation. I went to the beach several times and trust me, to walk the beach and play with a child and race her in nothing more than a small bathing suit, is a total ROAR for this girl. We seem to be constantly looking for an easy way out to gain confidence. I hate to share this reality check people, but confidence is something that we already have and have always had since our cute little butts were spanked at birth. Look no further, I have looked up the dictionary meaning of CONFIDENCE for your minds to grasp, here it is: confi-dence…1. full trust:belief in the powers, trustworthiness, or reliability of a person or thing.   2 .belief in oneself and one`s powers or abilities: self-confidence: self-reliance, assurance which implies faith in oneself. As you can see there, it is all inside of your head. You must belief in you. First and foremost, you must trust you and your abilities to survive with greatness and good feelings about who you are, what you look like, how you think, how you love, how you deal with unexpected events, but most of all how you continue to build your inner confidence, even when the going gets tough. There are so many outer elements that continue to test our inner confidence, that it’s no wonder we scramble at the best of times to smile, when we just want to scream. I have spoken of a few throughout my blogs: television, videos, reality shows, climbing of the “corporate ladder”, society`s constant attack on aging, over weight people, and please do not forget about the children. Children are faced with fears that threaten their confidence all the time. They fear their parents will look down on them for not having the best grades. They fear their peers will toss them to the curb if they do not follow. They hear continuously how messed up their world has become, and how it is teaching them negative things. How can that not weaken their CONFIDENCE. It would kill mine. I’m just happy that I was strong enough to know the difference between WWF wrestling, cartoons and real life. To ROAR with CONFIDENCE is as effective as telling the world to BITE ME! I love to say that as you all know.(winks) CONFIDENCE is not easy to keep strong, when we feel threatened inside, or we feel our relationship is being threatened. We immediately feel it is us, that are at fault, which in turn strikes down our confidence. We need to trust in ourselves, trust that we know what we want and what is good for us. Your life is not suppose to be a debate on how you should fit in, or whether someone tells you how to look or feel about you. You are your life. Your lack of confidence removes you from who you are meant to be. Trusting and having CONFIDENCE in you does not mean that you will always be right about things, but it does give you strength to overcome your doubts, low self-esteem and correct your wrongs and rise above the lesser you. I sometimes wonder why people do what they do. Is it because they lack confidence and feel that any type of attention will build their self-esteem? Or is it that they truly just do not care anymore and let themselves be the joke of the moment? I have the seen women in internet porn.(research purposes only) Now this is my opinion, so bear with me here: I am in no way judging anyone, but I do want to reach out to them and tell them there are better ways to build up confidence and feel wanted and appreciated. For the women that fall into the prostitution world and feel that is the only way to stardom; when did they lose their respect and self-esteem and when did they become afraid to ROAR with CONFIDENCE? Women that have been scorned and throw themselves away literally to the bar scene, where they become a piece of meat and are treated worse than a dog, you know that you are not happy there and that those roads to better feelings are not the right roads. How can one respect themselves if they have no strength to ROAR with CONFIDENCE? I cry for all women that have fallen into the traps of feeling that attention will bring them higher. They will never find their freedom to ROAR with CONFIDENCE if they continue to depend on anything or anyone outside of themselves to get them there. You need to save yourselves. You stay in negative environments where you feel threatened because you need so much acceptance that you have been mislead to believe that it will strengthen your CONFIDENCE. You were born with what you need to save you! DO NOT wait for help. Help yourself. Do not cry to be rescued, it will not happen. YOU and you alone, have to make that climb. Just trust your feelings and follow them. Trust that you alone, can give yourself all the strength to ROAR with CONFIDENCE.  I am hoping, that through my website and these written thoughts, that some women out there will wake up and see that they are unique without all the negative attention they feel is the way. Just be YOU! You can only be your best as being you. Not by following someone else`s standards, but only fulfilling your own. Love you first and most. Strive to ROAR with CONFIDENCE and DO NOT let anyone take you down.  You are you, and that in itself is a very special gift that no one else has. The more I believe in me, the easier it is for me to grow stronger inside and fight all the negative elements that I come across day after day. Life is not easy, nor does it come with any promises. As I have said so many times, “What does not kill you, will only make you stronger”. Live those words people and I mean it when I say it, ” ROAR with CONFIDENCE”. It truly is a feel good tip. (ROARZ) I seek myself in everything I do.\n\nI find myself.\n\nI dream my dreams wherever I go. I become myself.\n\nI ROAR with CONFIDENCE!\n\nDorothy Lafrinere\n\nOwner/Operator Website- http://www.womensselfesteem.com Weblog- http://www.justblogme.com/Dorothy \n\nemail- dorothy@womensselfesteem.com"},{title:"Believing Is The Absence Of Doubt",body:"You’ve heard the expression, “Just believe it and it will come.” Well, technically, that is true, however, ‘believing’ is not just thinking that you can have it; it is also feeling that it is possible.

I am going to take these teachings and apply them to feelings of giving up because nothing is happening in your home based MLM business opportunity, your online sales, your job, and etc. We all get down for one reason or another. The trick is to not give up, but get up and go forward in the face of adversity.\n\nThe first principle to remember is to talk to yourself instead of letting yourself talk to you. In chapter 42:5, the psalmist says, “Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me?” Have you tried everything that you knew possible and see others becoming successful, but doing the same thing is not working for you? In the back of your mind, you start telling yourself that you will never be successful. When those thoughts start cross your mind, you need to stop, take a deep breath and say to yourself, “I am going to be successful”. Think outside the box. Do not let your conscious get the best of you. If you have a mentor, talk to them. If you do not have a mentor, set up a small support group that will raise you up when you are down or vise versa. Remember this quote when dwelling on the past, “Success comes in cans, failure in cannot”\n\nThe second principle is to quit dwelling on things that are in the past and start dwelling on the present. In chapter 42:4, the psalmist says “This things I remember…” He also says in chapter 42:6 “my Savior and my God. My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon-from Mount Mizar.” Plainly said, “What is done, is done” Quit worry about things that did not work for you. Do not beat yourself up for things that you cannot change. Only think of ways to not make the same mistakes. Try new things! Again, think outside of the box. A famous quote from Ben Sweetland states “Success is a journey, not a destination.” You have to continually think about the present and your journey to success. The third principle is though there are many reasons to fail, there are far more reasons to succeed. The psalmist states in chapter 42:5, “Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him” This mean to not be bogged down in negativity. You may fail at one of your goals, get up, dust yourself off and try again. Always be focused on the big picture. Visualize yourself succeeding. One of my favorite quotes is by Dorothea Brande who states “To guarantee success, act as if it we impossible to fail”\n\nAnd the last principle is the affirmation of success must be repeated again and again in spite of failure. Within passage 42 and 43, the psalmist repeats the verse “Why are you downcast, O my soul?” three times. Three times he asks himself why he feels down. The psalmist is affirming that he has blessings to be thankful for. Think positively. Have you ever heard the expression to “will” something done? You have to do just that. You have to visualize your success. You have to see yourself in the new house, the new cars, money in the bank, running a successful business, etc. And you do this repeatedly, visualizing yourself succeeding no matter of the setbacks. Willie Davis says, “The road to success is uphill.” To succeed, you will constantly need to tell yourself that you are going to be successful.\n\nBy reading the passages, you see a man downcast and downtrodden. He is question himself. But we see that he talk himself out of depression. We also see him quit dwelling on the past and concern himself with the present. Even though he has reasons to burden himself with failures, he expatiates on the success. And last, and probably the most important, he affirmed his belief several times. When you get down, you need to do the same things. And one other important thing, you should only surround yourself with people who are positive and like-minded. You do not need any negativity in your life beating you down. “Will” yourself to success!"},{title:"Off To See The Wizard",body:"Do you remember the story of “The Wizard of Oz”? In this story we saw the characters of Dorothy, who had wanted to run away from home because she thought there was a better place somewhere. We also met the scarecrow who believed he had no brain, the lion who thought he had no courage, and the kindly tin man who assumed he had no heart.\n\nTogether the four of them set off to the Emerald City to find the wizard in hopes that he could bestow upon them these virtues and find a way for Dorothy to go back home. Even though Dorothy had thought she had wanted to be somewhere else, once she arrived in Munchkin Land she realized that hers dreams of being in a different place were not what she thought they would be. Disappointed in the reality she desperately wanted to return to Kansas and be with her loving family.\n\nHow many of us can relate to their dilemma? For some reason we think there is greener pasture on the other side or that we do not possess the characteristics necessary to fulfill our dreams.\n\nFrom a very young age, many of us are told that we can not do this or that because we do not have the talent or that we are not wise enough, or strong enough, or smart enough. What happens is that we end up living our lives in character with what others have told us about ourselves and in our personal belief system about ourselves. This jaded view of ourselves keeps us from doing the things we dream of doing. Many of us yearn for a magic wizard that would come along and bestow the qualities we feel are missing so we can do more with our lives.\n\nFor this reason we are afraid to step forward and go for our dreams. We feel inadequate to fulfill the calling ahead of us. From past experience we can see none of the characteristics necessary for us to reach our goal, our destination.\n\nWhat many of us were never told, is that we are all given those things necessary in life for us to move ahead, but because of our past experiences and lack of self confidence we tend to shrink back from going forward in our lives.\n\nMany people do not realize that self confidence comes from succeeding in an area that we wish to excel in. Success itself is not a one time event. In fact, it takes many failures and learning from our mistakes that make us eventually self reliant and confident.\n\nRemember when you first started riding a two wheel bike. It’s something that you really wanted to do. You saw your friends riding and were certain that it was something you could do. What happened? You tried and you most miserably failed. You would go a few short feet and then wobble and then bingo! You would fall again. Did you give up?\n\nNo! You got right back on that bike and kept practicing until you succeeded. The great baseball hero Babe Ruth was known for his fantastic batting. He could hit a ball right out of the park! Did he just get up one day and say, “Hey, I’m gonna hit every ball out of the park”? No, of course not. Sure, it was probably his dream to hit as many as he could out of the park but he knew in reality he needed to practice and practice, and hit and miss and eventually he would hit more than he would miss. Every ball player has a batting average. This means that they hit a number of balls but it also means that miss a lot of the balls or end up walking to base or striking out.\n\nWe may have specific goals. We want to hit that ball, but we must be prepared to fail in order to succeed. As we fail, we learn better how to hold the bat the next time or at what angle we need to swing the bat to hit the ball head on. Even if we become super proficient at this, there will still be times when we just miss the ball. That is part of life, but unless we get up to bat we will not be in the game.\n\nWhat about your dreams, are you giving them a fair shot. Sure you may not be perfect! Who is? The thing is, that you have to go after your dreams and not let failure or lack of self confidence hold you back.\n\nJust like the scarecrow, the lion and the tin man, we must go through the adversity and step forward in faith. Along the journey we will find that indeed we do have the qualities that we were longing for."},{title:"Put Wings On Your Dreams",body:"We Need Dreams\n\nDreams are important. Not the dreams you have when sleeping. I’m talking about the dreams you have for your future — the dreams that keep you going — the dreams that make each day worth living.\n\nDreams Aren’t Enough\n\nAs important as dreams are, they arent enough. Why? Dreams don’t take you where you want to go. A dream needs wings — to become a tangible vision — a passion that will take you where you REALLY want to be.\n\nBethany Hamilton lives in Hawaii — her passion is surfing — her dream is to become a professional surfer. She spends every available minute in the water, even home-schooling so she can have more time to pursue her vision. At 8 years of age she entered her first major competition taking the division championships that year. Bethany’s dream had become her passion — a tangible vision.\n\nWhen Your Vision Is Attacked\n\nBethany’s vision was viciously attacked on Halloween morning, 2003, when she was 13 years old. Bethany was lying on her board — left arm dangling in the cool water.\n\nShe remembers a flash of gray, pressure, and a couple fast tugs. She also remembers watching the jaws of a 15-foot tiger shark cover the top of her board and her left arm.\n\nThe shark was gone as fast as it appeared. So was her arm.\n\nWhat It Takes To Keep Your Vision Alive\n\nFast thinking friends and surgery saved Bethany’s life. Everyone — including Bethany — believed her surfing days were over. But within a week her vision returned — she rejected the fear and thoughts of defeat.\n\nLess than 30 days after the attack Bethany was back in the water. Her family and friends were there to cheer her on.\n\nHer first attempts were failures. She struggled to push herself up with one arm and keep her balance. Her fear was that her dream would die in the water that day — the shark victorious after all. Bethany pushed down her fears, gritted her teeth, and kept trying. And then it happened.\n\nTears rolled down her face — the crowd cheered — she caught her first wave and rode it in.\n\nThe Dream Takes Wing\n\nOnly months after the vicious attack, Bethany amazed thousands by achieving the unimaginable — taking 5th at the 2004 National Scholastic Surfing Association Nationals Championships. In September she struck again, winning the Open Women’s Division of the NSSA’s Hawaiian conference season opener. Having placed in the finals of the National Surfing Championships Bethany has secured a spot on USA’s National Surfing Team. She has truly conquered her fears!\n\nFive Ways To Put Wings On Your Dreams Bethany’s story shows how to put wings on your dreams:\n\n1) Your dream must become your passion — a tangible vision.\n\n2) Everything you do needs to fuel your vision.\n\n3) When your dream is attacked, face the adversity squarely and choose to overcome it with whatever it takes — face your fears and do it anyway!\n\n4) Make necessary adjustments — regain your balance — and keep your eyes on your goal.\n\n5) Accept help when it comes — with grace and gratitude — let it fuel your vision.\n\nFrom Dream to Vision to Reality\n\nBethany’s vision overcomes her fear of sharks and her continued nightmares. Her story teaches how to create dreams with wings that push you toward your life-goals.

It’s not critical for the employees to like the boss, but they have to trust him or her. If not, he won’t be able to lead them and the workers will have little motivation at work.\n\nTruth and trust are connected together. You could be honest for years but one lie can destroy the trust you have built all this time and there is no doubt that regaining that trust is very difficult.\n\nYou have to be honest. Do not say “I don’t know” when you know. Be straight and say exactly what you have in mind. When you say “No” mean it. We have to realize that the work place is not a popularity contest . Tasks need to be completed and work’s goals should be accomplished with success.\n\nTherefore, trying to be pleasant all the time will build obstacles to your job and disorientate you from your real goals at work.\n\nOpen your ears and accept criticism from employees or colleagues. It’s hard for every person to accept comments – especially negative – but in order to lead you will have to. Always listen to other ideas, suggestions and encourage open discussions. That doesn’t mean, in case you are the manager that you don’t decide according to your facts.\n\nDemonstrate the trust. Just saying “I trust you” is not enough. You have to show it by assigning responsibilities and providing all the tools they need in order to succeed in the tasks you assign to them. When we say tools we mean training, information e.t.c\n\nRecognize the well done job. People need to be appreciated especially at work. When an employee is productive, and finishes the assignment successfully show your appreciation directly. People need the approval to be in public and the negative comments in private. It’s in human nature, we can’t change it, and so it is important to follow that rule.\n\nRecent research analyzes that workers do not care only about the money. They want to be educated at work, to take initiatives and also play a part in resolving problems that occur.\n\nTo sum it up, you have to do what you preach, and be clear with your actions. When you say “No” or “Yes” mean them, and of course you have to give the example. If you enforce a rule at your company but you are the only one who breaks it, don’t expect the rule to last for long. Especially the trust will vanish, and leading your team will become extremely difficult task."},{title:"Train Your Brain This New Years",body:"It’s that time again when people start thinking about their New Years Resolutions.

Usually, this is the last thing people consider, but in reality it’s one of the best things you can do for yourself and those around you.\n\nPeople who want to build their muscles know that it takes time to work on specific areas in order for the muscles to develop properly and these same people will pay big bucks to join the local gym to work on these areas and yet they forget to invest in things that will enrich their minds.\n\nBy enriching your mind and building yourself up mentally you will be able to challenge yourself to take on other areas of your life that need improvement. Your life is influenced by your thought processes.\n\nYou can learn to build up the muscles in your mind, so to speak, and strengthen your inner man with positive goal producing thoughts.\n\nMost New Year Resolutions fail, mainly because people do not have the proper mind set to set proper goals and lack the ability to make a roadmap that will lead them to success.\n\nWhat is it you want for you and your family next year?

body:"Healthy self esteem originates in the environment found in the: family, school, peer group, work place, and community. There are certain characteristics of your environment that need to be present in order for self esteem to be fostered and grow.\n\nThe main component of a healthy environment for self esteem is that it needs to be nurturing. It should provide unconditional warmth, love, and caring. It needs to provide the realization that other people are recognized as deserving to be nurtured, reinforced, rewarded, and bonded to. \n\nHealthy environment for self esteem transmits messages of warmth, loving, and caring by physical touch, meeting the survival needs of food, clothing and shelter, and providing a sense of stability and order in life. A healthy environment for self esteem should provide acceptance. It will recognize that other people see each other as worthy individuals who have a unique set of personality characteristics, skills, abilities, and competencies making them special. Acceptance enables people to develop relationships with others, yet maintain healthy boundaries of individuality within themselves. In the healthy environment for self esteem should be good communication, everyone should be heard and responded to in a healthy way so that healthy problem solving is possible. Appropriate giving and receiving of feedback is encouraged and rewarded. Communicating at a “feelings” level is a mode of operation for these people, allowing them to be in touch with their emotions in a productive manner. The healthy environment for self esteem must contain recognition and acceptance of people for who they are. That recognition and acceptance should not be based on the condition that they must first conform to a prescribed standard of behavior or conduct. This is unhealthy. Unconditional recognition and acceptance given in the form of support allows individuals to reach their ultimate potential. The healthy environment for self esteem should be clearly defined and enforced limits known to individuals with no hidden tricks or manipulation. Limits set the structure for the lives of individuals, allowing clear benchmarks of appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Limits enable individuals to recognize their responsibilities and to chart their course of behavior in a rational way. Respect and latitude for individual action within the defined limits of the healthy environment for self esteem should be present as well. This encourages individuals to use their creativity, ingenuity, and imagination to be productive within the established structure. Restrictions that suppress individuality can lead to a narrow focus, with people becoming stunted and handicapped in the use of their personal skills, abilities, and resources. Finally, healthy environment for self esteem should be bonding, which is the physical/emotional phenomenon between individuals and the others in their environment. This is necessary for the development of healthy self esteem. Bonding is forming a mutual emotional attachment between an individual and a “significant other” (parent, child, friend, lover, etc.). This involves the significant other giving unconditional love and support as well as developing an emotional link between each other."},{title:"Dream Interpretation Common Symbols And Their Meanings",body:"Dream interpretation has many forms; it can be done be done for the sake of fun, hobby or can be taken up as a serious career.

I’ve attended regularly over the past fifteen years and my\n\nbody deterioration is almost being kept in check.\n\nHowever I’ve always noticed a lot of new faces at the gym,\n\nsome of which seem to disappear over a short period of time.\n\nMost gyms and health clubs have a high turnover of members\n\nor “churn” as the marketing people like to call it.\n\nOne club I know of loses around fifty members a month and\n\nhas to work hard to sign up that number just for the\n\nbusiness to stand still.\n\nIt’s not that these gyms offer a poor service, on the\n\ncontrary – it’s because the members – “give up.”\n\nNew members join to lose weight or to get fit. They then\n\ntorture themselves on the rowing machines and all the other\n\ninstruments of agony. If, after a few weeks of sweat and\n\npain, they don’t see any visible result – they give up. You’re probably away ahead of me on this; because the key\n\nsecret of success that I mentioned earlier is this – NEVER\n\nEVER GIVE UP.\n\nThis is what separates the winners from the losers in\n\nbusiness, in sport and in life – this is what success is all\n\nabout.\n\nIf you have a mountain to climb either literally or\n\nfiguratively and you reach an obstacle – don’t give up.\n\nFind another way round – even go back a short distance and\n\ncome at the situation from another direction.\n\nWhatever it is you’re trying to achieve, whatever success\n\nyou want – never give up! Make mistakes – fall down – get up\n\n– fall down – but get up and try again. So there you have it – If you want success remember what\n\nWinston Churchill once said – “Never – Never – Never give"},{title:"The Small Change That Creates Massive Results In Your Life",body:"“It is never too late to become what you might have been.” – GEORGE ELIOT\n\nI believe that we all reach certain key points in our lives. We all reach crossroads where our lives hit a certain threshold of “pain” that we are no longer willing to settle for. This threshold is very different for every person. I also believe that if you are unhappy with anything in your life then that is a call to action; a desire from deep within the “real” you that wants to experience more of life. This can be very challenging for a lot of people as they have this urge to improve their lives but they don’t have an effective strategy. They then do the “logical” thing which is to work on the effects instead of the cause. Here is a simple thought process that will be a wake up call to you if you feel like you are spinning your wheels.\n\nFor my life to get better I have to get better. For things to change I have to change. I am mine. This is my life and I am the creator of my destiny.\n\nI can change any and everything in my life by simply changing myself. This puts me in the driving seat of my life and makes my life my responsibility. It eliminates fear and apprehension for I know that no matter what life gives me I can always get to the next level and take the next step by simply making the internal shift in my own psychology.\n\nI can stop looking for events, people and circumstances to blame. I only need to look inside. No matter how influential you are you cannot control the circumstances and events of your life. There are only three things over which you have absolute and total control and these are all you need. It forms the total experience of life. My thoughts, my actions and my words are always under my conscious control. They are MY thoughts, they are MY actions and they are MY words AND they create MY world every minute of every day.\n\nThis is incredibly liberating. Whenever I want to have more, experience more or change anything, I need only look inwards and work on myself. Jim Rohn once said that the hardest work you will ever do is the work you do on yourself. See, you can run around and work incredibly hard at trying to influence and change circumstances, but that will only make you tired and discourage your future efforts. It’s much easier to change yourself and your perception of yourself and your life. Nothing has any meaning except for the meaning you give it.\n\nChanging external events have very little impact in your life on the long term. Small changes in you; in your perceptions and psychology might seem insignificant at first, but because the change is in you it effects all of your thoughts, all of your actions and all of your words. This seemingly insignificant change, over time changes the whole direction and end destination of your life. If a captain of a ship changes direction just one degree the end destination might be a different continent all together. Like the captain changing his course by one degree it might be unnoticeable over a short period of time, but over greater distances the small change becomes very significant.\n\nMost people try and change the big things; they constantly try and change any and everything in their lives, but they then fail to maintain the change. Instead, making small consistent changes in yourself, in your own character you can create phenomenal results. All change starts and ends with you. If you are going to invest the time and effort to improve your life, then invest it in changing yourself. Invest your time and effort in improving “you” and let go of the superficial urges to control events and circumstances. Your whole perception and experience of life comes from you and who you are. Change yourself, improve your character and just watch the world improve and change before your very eyes."},{title:"The Key To Your Motivation And Success",body:"What sets successful people apart from the pack? Is it luck, money, good lucks, and/or talent?\n\nNo, it is one small simple fact — motivation.\n\nPeople who are successful all share one trait — they are motivated.\n\nOf course, motivation really isn’t simple at all. That is why there is multi-billion industry focused on self-help books, tapes, seminars, camps, and coaches.\n\nThere is just one problem with using these methods. When it comes to motivation one size does not fit all. One of the elements that makes human beings so endlessly fascinating is that we are all individuals.It is the primary reason our species has been so successful. It also means we each have different interests, goals, and motivation.\n\nSo before you can begin following any one of the thousands of motivational programs available you must first determine which motivational group you fall into.\n\nAfter some thought, study, and research, I have come up with four basic motivational categories: ~ The Pessimist ~ The Competitor ~ The Minimalist ~ The Exhibitionist\n\nThe Pessimist\n\nThe Pessimist is personified by my husband. Whenever he gets the smallest bit of bad news he immediately leaps into the deep end of doom and gloom. It doesn’t matter if the problem is small or large, he often reacts as if it is the end of the world. If the satellite dish has a momentary hiccup in service then he immediately assumes the bill didn’t get paid and our account terminated and our credit score is now on the decline.\n\nIt took me a long time to learn how to deal with this. At first I thought it was real panic and I would try to shield him from the smaller hiccups, and even some big ones, of life. But now I know this is actually how he motivated himself.\n\nWhen we face challenges, big or small, he works himself through a familiar cycle. First he outlines the worst-case scenario, then he outlines his options for action, and then he takes action. And when he takes action just get out of the way as he moves very quickly — and successfully. Challenge faced, problem solved. It makes me crazy but it works for him!\n\nThe Competitor\n\nMy brother thrives on competition. Whether he is playing sports or working in sales, he is always more successful if he has competition.If his motivation flags he can easily juice himself up with a quick comparison of his progress toward a particular goal in comparison to others. He likes to keep score and that keeps him motivated. He wants to win whatever competition is at hand.\n\nDon’t knock this method. By almost any measure my brother is a huge success and has worked his way from a contract employee barely able to afford his two-bedroom apartment to a high-level sales executive with a six-figure salary plus bonuses to further incentivize him.\n\nThe Minimalist\n\nPerhaps this person might best be described as having a short-attention span. They need short-term goals that are immediately visible and can be achieved within a short time span. They can go the distance as long as it is broken up into smaller projects. Each small victory will spur them on to the final goal but they need those little successes to keep them motivated. In many ways this label applies to me but I think down deep that I am really in the final category.\n\nThe Exhibitionist\n\nI know I fall into this category because I have a very difficult time with goals that I cannot see. It is one of the reasons I hate cleaning — sure you can see the results but with a busy family you know how long those results stay visible!\n\nLike the minimalist I enjoy breaking large projects up into small, bite-sized chunks so they are not so overwhelming. When I grade papers for my teaching gig I always divide the pile into several smaller piles so I can feel I am making progress. I do the same with cleaning — first straighten the room, then dust, then vacuum.\n\nBut it isn’t enough for me to accomplish the task — I need to have a to do list that I can check off as I go and then crumple up and throwin the trash at the end of the day. I need to be able to point to some visible success for the day whether it is a shining kitchen, a stack of graded papers, or a pile of completed manuscript pages.\n\nWhich category do you fall into? Once you know that much about yourself you will be better able to find the motivation technique that works best for you.

Maybe what I mean to say is did they really have a chance. You can take two people, present them with the same fork in the road, and one is going to have an easier time than the other choosing the right path.\n\nIs there such a thing as the right path? You could argue back and forth with God and Evolution and such topics. The side that you take in an arguement like that might lead you to think that you know the meaning to life. How can we really know though. At least up until now there isn’t and 100% proof to either side. If God was a gaurantee – why would he leave so many of us here to die, without the information or say it as proof that we individually would have needed to make that choice? If Evolution was a gaurantee – why would there be two thousand years of person to person proof that Jesus walked on Earth? We’ve already seen alot of weird things happen in our lifetime, and I think that we will see alot more. Our world is too much of an unstable place, and as time grows on we just grow out further. Every Civilization has fallen. How long do you think we have? Look at America. We’re built on a pretty rough foundation. Events like the Hurricanes, have humbled us, and showed us how vulnerable we are to things we can’t avoid. Our entire economy is built on Oil, and we are feeling the effects of the instability in the Oil world. Will the next war be over oil. Was the last one?\n\nThe Persian Gulf has over half of the word’s oil sitting underneath it, but they can’t seem to get their act together above the surface. The United States is the larget consumer of Oil, and they only have 3% of the world’s oil reserves. How long can they go on, being so dependent on Oil, and borrowing as much as they do. Well into the Trillions, the US is the world’s largest debtor. That makes me wonder where all that money is coming from. The 30’s showed us what happens when the markets collapse. Are we smart enough to keep our economy going in the 00’s? I don’t think so. Not when we have monkeys like Bush kicking about. Not to pick on him in particular but here are some funny links:"},{title:"All Faith Needs Feet",body:"A subscriber recently wrote to me: A friend of mine is on a fixed income and has maxed out his credit cards (nearing $10,000). He has started a new business, but currently has no customers or prospects. He is affirming that he is already successful and debt-free. What is the best way for him? Should he write checks to pay his bills as they arrive, even though the money may not be in his account at the moment? Wouldn’t these concrete actions demonstrate his faith?My Answer: Faith is a wonderful thing – and very necessary. There are, however, approaches that may look like faith but lead us in risky directions.\n\nPlease tell your friend that he needs to pay close attention to “real” actions and concentrate on learning to provide a service to other people that they want. (Note the emphasis is on what “they” want.) Paying bills with rubber checks isn’t an act of faith. It’s desperate gambling. I know from hard experience that it’s nearly impossible to get the right mindset for real faith or confidence when you’re circling the drain. Your friend needs to get his feet firmly under himself with real money — even if he has to go tend bar or wash dishes for the extra income for a bit. Honest, it’s no disgrace (unless he stays there).\n\nRemember that all faith needs feet. If you’re in an airplane on its way down in a power dive, you put on your parachute first. And THEN you do affirmations. The old biblical phrase “faith without works is dead” means just that – belief needs to be connected organically with action. Productive action. If it’s not, then it’s not true belief, it’s only an attempt to con yourself and the gods.\n\nToo many people hope that they can do affirmations or pray or ASSERT, and this will save them from having to make a decision and take action. But that’s not the way it works. Action and affirmations must be bonded together as a single unit and support each other like two legs. Neither faith nor action can stand alone.\n\nSo you might want to tell your friend that positive thinking is good (and absolutely necessary), but positive action is also an essential ingredient. Simply put, he’ll never pray himself up a hill. When he’s willing to take action, with all the stops out, his faith will bring the lucky breaks, the synchronicities, and the chance meetings with just the right people at the right times to help move him forward. But it’s the action that anchors all that potentiality into reality. ACTION. Otherwise, it’s all vapor. “Willing to take action with all the stops out” … some folks call that enthusiasm, others call it commitment. But it sure boosts the octane.\n\nIt’s often hard to get people to see that taking a detour on the way to their goals is not a “wrong turn.” It’s just another way of getting where they’re going. Whatever it takes. Just remember that you don’t have to give up on your dreams and goals when some little thing comes along (or not so little). The goal is what’s important, not every little step it takes to get there (as long as we remember to TAKE the steps). I’d guess that the old gremlin of impatience has killed more dreams than any other single influence. It’s so common to think, “If I’m not getting there RIGHT NOW, then that’s it; I’ll never make it.” It might help to think of your vision of your future as a very penetrating stare. It penetrates anything that may seem to block your path. As long as you keep seeing what’s in your future, you won’t become stalled by the stuff that crops up in front of you today. This may all sound trite, but it’s true, every bit of it. And I learned it all the absolutely hardest way. I lived through it over and over and over and…\n\nBut eventually, even a super-dense guy like me can learn, proving that anybody on earth can do it."},{title:"Success Steps For Your Personal Or Business Life",body:"Fact: Success is something of which we all want more.\n\nFact: Most people believe that success is difficult.\n\nFact: They’re wrong – it’s not!\n\nSuccess isn’t really that difficult. There is a significant portion of the population here in North America, that actually want and need success to be hard! Why? So they then have a built-in excuse when things don’t go their way! Pretty sad situation, to say the least.\n\nFor those of you who are serious about having more, doing more, giving more and being more, success is achievable with some understanding of what to do, some discipline around planning and execution of those plans and belief that you can achieve your desires.\n\nThe Truth About Success\n\nThe first thing to remember about success is that it is a process – nothing more, nothing less. There is really no magic to it and it’s not reserved only for a select few people. As such, success really has nothing to do with luck, coincidence or fate. It really comes down to understanding the steps in the process and then executing on those steps.\n\nThere are basically six key areas to higher achievement. Some people will tell you there are four while others may tell you there are eight. One thing for certain though, is that irrespective of the number of steps the experts talk about, they all originate from the same roots.\n\nFrom my perspective then, here are the six key steps:\n\n1. Making the decision\n\n2. Clarity – developing the Vision\n\n3. Focus – having a plan\n\n4. Commitment – understanding the price and having the willingness to pay that price\n\n5. Belief – believing in yourself and those around you\n\n6. Taking action – practice Ready, Fire, Aim…\n\nMaking the Decision\n\nIf success is a process with a number of defined steps, then it is just like any other process. So, what is the first step in any process?\n\nMaking a decision to do something – this is the first step. We all know that nothing moves until someone makes a decision. The first action is always in making the decision to proceed. This is a fundamental step, which most people overlook.\n\nSo, make the decision to move forward. Commit your decision to paper, just to bring it into focus. Then, go for it!\n\nClarity\n\nHaving clarity of purpose and a clear picture of what you desire, is probably the single most important factor in achievement. Why is Clarity so important?\n\nWithout clarity, you send a very garbled message out to the Universe. We know that the Law of Attraction says that we will attract what we focus on, so if we don’t have clarity, we will attract confusion.\n\nConsider the following analogy:\n\nYou are going on a cruise, but when the ship sets sail, you discover it has no rudder. What happens? One of 3 things will occur:\n\n1. You will sail along until you collide with an immovable object, after which you will sink to the bottom\n\n2. You will run aground and become hopelessly stuck in the mud\n\n3. You will drift aimlessly until you arrive back at the original dock\n\nTrying to go through life without clarity is similar to sailing a rudder-less ship – no good thing can or will happen!\n\nThe sad thing is the majority of people have no clue about what they truly want. They have no clarity. When asked the question, responses will be superficial at best, and at worst, will be what someone else wants for them.\n\nSo how do we get clarity? Simply by asking ourselves lots of questions: What do I really want? What does success look like to me? Why do I want a particular thing? How will this achievement change my life? How can I use this success to make a difference for others?\n\nIntrospection is the trick. Understand what you want, why you want it and what it will do for you. This is a critical factor, and as such, is probably the most difficult step. For this reason, most people never complete this aspect – then wonder why life is so difficult!\n\nOnce you have a clear understanding of what you want, it is critical that you engage in goal setting – specifically setting SMART goals.\n\nSMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time Sensitive – S-M-A-R-T. Knowing what you want and setting SMART goals as mileposts on your quest cannot help but give you clarity!\n\nFocus\n\nFocus is having the unwavering attention to complete what you set out to do. There are a million distractions in every facet of our lives. Telephones and e-mail, clients and managers, spouses and kids, TV, newspapers and radio – the distractions are everywhere and endless. Everyone wants a piece of us and the result can be totally overwhelming.\n\nSo, how can we stay on course with all the distractions in our lives? Willpower is a good start, but it’s very difficult to stay on track simply through willpower.\n\nThe best way is to develop and follow a plan. Start with your goals in mind and then work backwards to develop the plan. What steps are required to get you to the goals? Make the plan as detailed as possible. Try to visualize and then plan for, every possible setback. Commit the plan to paper and then keep it with you at all times. Review it regularly and ensure that every step takes you closer to your Vision and Goals. If the plan doesn’t support the vision then change it!\n\nAlong with your plans, you should consider developing an action orientation that will keep you motivated to move forward at all times. This requires a little self-discipline, but is a crucial component to achievement of any kind. Before starting any new activity, ask yourself if that activity will move you closer to your goals. If the answer is no, you may want to reconsider doing it at that time.\n\nI coach my clients to practice the 3 D’s – Defer, Delegate or Delete. Can the particular activity be done later? Defer it! Can it be done by someone else? Delegate it! Does it need to be done at all? If not, consider deleting it! Posing these questions will help to keep you focused on what is truly important! \n\nCommitment\n\nCommitment is something that comes from understanding that everything has its price and then having the willingness to pay that price. This is important because nobody wants to put significant effort into something, only to find out after the fact that the price was too high.\n\nThe price is something not necessarily defined as financial. It could be time, effort, sacrifice, money or perhaps, something else. The point is that we must be fully aware of the price and be willing to pay it, if we want to have success.\n\nBelief\n\nThis is perhaps the single biggest obstacle that all of us must overcome in order to be successful.\n\nWe all carry a lot of baggage, thanks to our upbringing. The majority of people carry with them, an entire series of self-limiting beliefs that will absolutely stop, and hold them back from, success. Things like “I’m not good enough”, “I’m not smart enough”, “I’m not lucky enough”, and the worst, “I’m not worthy” are but a few of the self-limiting beliefs I have encountered. We carry them with us like rocks in a knapsack, and then use them to sabotage our success. So, how twisted is that?!?!\n\nThe old expression is absolutely true – whether you think you can or you can’t, you’re right!\n\nOne of the main areas that I work on with my clients is shedding these non-supportive beliefs and replacing them with beliefs that will help them to accomplish their desires.\n\nIt is truly amazing the damage that we, as parents, can inflict on our children. So why do we do it? For the most part, we don’t do it intentionally or with malice. In the majority of cases, the cause is a well-meaning but unskilled or un-thinking parent, who says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and the message sticks – as simple as that!\n\nAnd it’s not just parents that are the cause – teachers, friends, clergy members or anyone else that has influence in a child’s life can be a contributor to these self-limiting beliefs!\n\nThe bottom line is that we must shed the bad and replace with good beliefs.\n\nTaking Action\n\n“Nothing changes until something moves” – this is the battle cry of author and journalist Robert Ringer. And he is absolutely correct. Not all of the decision-making, clarity, planning, focus and belief in the world, will get you to where you want to be, without taking action!\n\nAction – putting your plans into play – that is what will get you to the destination. Don’t get caught in the paralysis of analysis, or in the conundrum of Ready, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim…\n\nGet the oars in the water and start rowing. Execution is the single biggest factor in achievement, so the faster and better your execution, the quicker you will get to the goals!\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, there you have it; the six steps that will help you to the fabled land of achievement and success! You now have the opportunity to push ahead and reach your potential. No more excuses – make the commitment to take action TODAY!\n\nFigure out what you want, put a plan together to achieve it, understand the cost, believe in yourself then go and get it!"},{title:"Enhance Wellness By Doing Something Different With Nlp",body:"Many people would say that it is absolute madness to keep on doing the same thing, time after time, expecting to get a different result or for something different to happen. Alternatively, many people, especially those in the personal development, NLP and wellness fields of varying natures, would describe it as intelligent to have a goal and be wonderfully flexible about how you go about achieving it. \n\nIt is this intelligent idea of enhancing wellness that I want to highlight today with NLP.  \n\nIf what you’re doing isn’t working or increasing your wellness, do something else;\n\nI was working with a corporate client recently and had been working with one of their senior managers using NLP and various other techniques. He had wanted his team to carry out a piece of project work in a certain way. He said to me that he had told them again and again (12 times in total), but they still weren’t doing what he wanted. I pointed out that if he wanted them to change what they were doing, he might have to change what he was doing; I suggested that he be more flexible. Together, We explored some alternative approaches and things started to change. \n\nIf you are fed up with getting the same results to certain things over and over, with whatever it is that you are looking to change, use this notion to begin to disrupt your existing pattern. If you are just following the idea through in some way, by definition you are perceiving it differently and doing yourself lots of favours. You’ll be increasing your wellness. \n\nSo, firstly, identify an area where you’ve been doing the same thing over and over hoping to get a different result. Or an area that you want to increase your wellness. It may relate to a behaviour, habit, circumstance or situation; just choose something that you want to change the outcome of. Then secondly, clarify your goal, that is, clarify what you want to achieve. Do this by asking yourself what you want and how you will know when you have got it.  Thirdly, construct or create a list of the different approaches and behaviours you have tried already in order to achieve this goal or increased wellness. Or note down what it is that you are doing currently.  Finally and most simply, put together a nice list of some alternative behaviours you will use to achieve the goal and increase wellness. Enlist some help ifyou feel it would help. When you have compiled a good list (put stuff down on that list that may well not seem right for you, it is good to explore avenues that in the past made you feel uncomfortable from time to time). Then, of course, look at starting to do the things that are on your list; do them. \n\nWhat I am wanting to get across here is the idea of being more bendy.\n\nYour mind and your body really are a single system, so it follows that physical flexibility can often lead to greater mental flexibility. There are certain activities which can greatly increase physical flexibility, including things like Yoga, Martial arts, Dancing, Swimming and lots of other general forms of exercise. \n\nPracticing any of these will increase your overall behavioural and mental flexibility and level of wellness. In addition, find opportunities to break habitual patterns. For instance, most mornings when I shave, I do it in a different way. This requires me to stay aware and vary my patterns. The more flexibility you have, the more flexibility you can bring to situations involving others. Often, when people are seeing me for reducing their weight, I might suggest that they look at the doing things like swapping their knife and fork hands around for a week.\n\nSo, go ahead and identify a habitual pattern and change it to enhance your wellness. Especially if it is something you are not entirely happy about. Here is a list of some things that you can do to interrupt your existing patterns and increase your wellness, you can be as creative as you want with these things.  -Eat a food that you never usually eat \n\n-Go for a walk at an early hour in the morning \n\n-Watch a TV show you would never usually watch \n\n-Take a different journey home from work \n\n-Take a cold shower \n\n-Answer your phone with the opposite hand to usual \n\n-Laugh and smile for no reason \n\nThe sooner you start doing this, the more fun you’ll have with it. Then often, the higher your increase in wellness. So many people I encounter, know all this stuff or read it and still don’t do these things and wonder why they are not getting what they want. Do soemthing different today and you’ll be amazed how your wellness rockets."
},{title:"Do You Think Motivational Thoughts",body:"What do motivational thoughts do? They help you take action. This isn’t about positive thinking or motivating quotes. Those have their place in shaping your attitude and thinking. However, what motivates each of us is unique, so you need to have your own thoughts – those which are most effective at getting you going.\n\n“In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity” – Albert Einstein\n\nThis is a decent quote, and it may help you look at the positive side of a situation, but what if it just doesn’t get you excited? Then you need to apply a little brainpower to make the idea your own. You have to make it a truly motivational thought for YOU.\n\nMotivational Thoughts Of Your Own\n\n“Making it your own” means experimenting with a good thought until you find a way to use it in your own recipe for motivation. Suppose, for example, you’re in a difficult situation and don’t feel like dealing with it. As you sit there, you play around with the idea of opportunity coming from difficulty. Fortunately, you discover that it pulls you out of your slump to think about yourself in the future, explaining to a friend how you turned the difficult situation to your advantage.\n\nThis is how you create your own motivational thoughts. Now, it might be more motivating if you imagine yourself being interviewed someday about how you overcame this difficult time. The thoughts that work for you are the thoughts you need to be thinking.\n\nLearn Your Motivations\n\nExperiment and get to know how your mind works. I find that beyond just thinking a thought, if I explain it to someone, I get excited. That is my own self-motivation recipe. When I feel unmotivated about writing, for example, all I explain an idea I have for some article to my wife. By the time I am done, I’m very motivated to work. You can get creative in your motivational experiments. Maybe thinking about being poor makes you get up and get to work. If so, that is a great motivational thought. If visual thoughts are more motivating than mental conversations, then use those. See pictures in your head that get you going. Perhaps when people say you can’t do something, you do whatever it takes to prove them wrong. Then it might be motivational to think about them saying you can’t.\n\nWhen there is a truly uninspiring task you have to do, try promising yourself a reward for completion – make it one that really means something to you. Keep that thought in your mind to keep yourself motivated. A trip to the beach and even a simple bowl of ice cream may be some of your more powerful motivational thoughts."},{title:"The A Z Of Motivation",body:"Pain may sometimes be the reason why people change. Getting bad grades make you realize that you need to study. Debts remind you of your inability to look for a source of income. Being humiliated gives you the ‘push’ to speak up and fight for yourself to save your face from the next embarrassment. It may be a bitter experience, a friend’s tragic story, a great movie, or an inspiring book that will help you to get up and get just the right amount of motivation you need in order to improve yourself.\n\nWith all the people trying to pull you down and waiting for you to fail, how can you stay motivated and positive?\n\nTry this A to Z of tips for motivation\n\nA – Achieving your dreams. Avoid negative people, things and places because they will only drag you down. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”\n\nB – Believe in your self, and in what you can do. Believe in your possibilities and your dreams. Every advancement of humankind has taken place because someone believed in themselves.\n\nC – Consider all of the angles and aspects of everything you encounter, whether it is people or situations. Motivation comes from strength of purpose. Being able to see both points of view will give you more chance of being successful and keeping those around you motivated too.\n\nD – Don’t give up and don’t give in. Every successful person from J K Rowling to Walt Disney to Sylvester Stallone to Thomas Edison had multiple failures before being successful. Sometimes their failures or rejections ran into the hundreds before they achieved success.\n\nE – Enjoy. Work as if you don’t need money. Dance as if nobody’s watching. Love as if you never cried. Learn as if you’ll live forever. Motivation takes place when people are happy.\n\nF – Family and Friends. Use your family and friends to help you stay motivated. The big football teams have cheerleaders and fans to encourage them. Your family and friends can be your cheerleaders and fans. Use them to keep you going when you feel your motivation drifting.\n\nG – Give that little bit extra. Self improvement happens everywhere all the time, whether you are at home, at work or at school. Anthony Robbins tells us that the difference in effort between excellent and outstanding is miniscule, yet the difference in rewards is massive. Giving that little bit extra can put you into the outstanding.\n\nH – Hang on to your dreams. There may be times when it looks bleak, but hang on to your dreams. The night is darkest just before the dawn. It is at this moment that you are closest to success and 95% of people will give up. Push through this moment and you’ll achieve your dreams.\n\nI – Ignore those who try to destroy you. Don’t get involved in their dramas or toxicity – just walk away. Surround yourself with people who will encourage and support you. Remove those who want to pull you down and watch you fail from your life. You’ll find it much easier to stay motivated.\n\nJ – Joy and gratitude. Perhaps two of the fundamentals for motivation and success is to be joyful in what you do and grateful for what you have.\n\nK – Keep pushing forwards no matter how hard life may seem. In the toughest moments you can choose to move forwards or to run away. It’s your decision – one path brings you closer to the success, the other takes you away from it. Which do you want to follow?\n\nL – Learn to love your self. This isn’t as easy as it sounds for most people, but by loving yourself you will be happier and more motivated because you will believe you deserve what you achieve.\n\nM – Make things happen. Motivation and success doesn’t come from sitting in front of the television drinking coke and eating pizza. Take action and you’ll achieve your dreams.\n\nN – Never lie, cheat or steal. Always play a fair game. At the end of the day, if you live a dishonest life, it will come back to you. Living an honest, fair life allows you to be proud of what you do.\n\nO – Open your eyes. Everyone has a set of blinkers that they wear and see everything through them, i.e. how they would like things to be. Look at life with open eyes and see things how they are, and see them how you want them to be. Then take action to make it happen.\n\nP – Practice makes perfect. The more you practice, the better you become. A top sportsman doesn’t reach their status through a single practice or game. They practice harder and longer than anyone else, and as such, are rewarded more than anyone else.\n\nQ – Quitters never win. And winners never quit. So, which do you want to be?\n\nR – Ready yourself. Always be ready to take advantage of the opportunities and situations presented to you. Prepare in advance, and ignore the voice telling you to put it off until tomorrow. Remember, it wasn’t raining when Noah built the ark!\n\nS – Stop procrastinating. You can put it all off until tomorrow, but one day there will be no more tomorrows. Start procrastinating about procrastinating and do tomorrows jobs today.\n\nT – Take control of your life. Discipline and self control are synonymous with motivation. So many people believe their lives are out of their control. Look at your life in detail and you’ll discover you have more areas under your control than you think.\n\nU – Understand others. If you know very well how to talk, you should also learn how to listen. You have two ears and one mouth for a reason. Understand others and strive to be understood.\n\nV – Visualise it. Your sub-conscious knows no difference between your imagination and reality, so if you rehearse your success in your mind, then your sub-conscious will believe in it and make it happen.\n\nW – Want it more than anything. Every successful person has had a burning desire to achieve their goals. The Wright brothers didn’t invent the aeroplane because there was nothing on the television. They had a burning desire to succeed and kept going, even in the face of setbacks.\n\nX – X Factor is what will make you different from the others. When you are motivated, you tend to put on “extras” on your life like extra time for family, extra help at work, extra care for friends. This X-Factor sets you aside from the crowd and marks you out for success.\n\nY – You are unique. No one in this world looks, acts, thinks or talks like you. Value your unique gifts, whatever they are and use them for your success.\n\nZ – Zero in on your dreams and make it happen!!!"},{title:"A Great Way To Generate All The Motivation You Need To Get Fit",body:"If you’re having trouble getting motivated to keep to your fitness program … or if you haven’t even got off the starting block yet, this article could change your life! Not completely … that would be too ambitious! But, there’s a tiny, inexpensive device that can provide you with all the motivation you need to get out and start moving your body around a bit more. The pedometer, as it’s known, can also make you WANT to do it and can even get you to ENJOY doing it!\n\nWhat … ? ENJOY exercising??? Surely some mistake? Well, no actually. Please read on. 1. So, what is a pedometer? \n\nIt’s a small, compact device used for measuring the number of steps taken. And, as well as measuring the number of steps taken when exercising in your local neighborhood, it can also measure your steps whilst you’re climbing the stairs, mowing the lawn, or doing the shopping. 2. How Does It Work? \n\nIt’s small enough to clip to your belt and is fitted with a pendulum which measures one step each time your foot makes contact with the ground. \n\n3. How Much Does It Cost? \n\nMany pedometers have been given away FREE as part of campaigns by local health authorities to get people moving their bodies more.\n\nIf you can’t find such a campaign in your area, you can buy a pedometer with a reasonable number of features for as little as $20. 4. What Exactly Does It Do? \n\nYou should buy a model which, at the very least, measures the number of steps taken, calories burned, distance walked, speed you’ve been walking and how long your routine has taken.\n\nMore expensive models may include any or all of the following additional features:\n\n– a soothing voice to tell you how many steps you’ve taken\n\n– a pulse monitor\n\n– a stopwatch\n\n– a radio and headphones so you can listen to your favorite radio station whilst out walking\n\n– a step filter to achieve greater accuracy\n\n– a back light so you can see your pedometer in the dark. 5. How Do I Set Up My Pedometer? \n\nFirst you need to enter your height, weight and average stride length.\n\nTo arrive at your stride length, most instruction guides prompt you to measure out a distance of, say 10 meters, and to count the number of steps you take to cover it. Divide this number by the overall distance and this gives your average stride length.\n\nOnce it’s set up, just follow the instructions to activate the settings you want to use, clip your pedometer to your belt and you’re ready to go.\n\n6. How Do I Take Readings?  At any point after you’ve started your routine, you can stop, flip open the pedometer and take a reading. Of course, you shouldn’t do this too often as this will interrupt the rhythm of your walk. But you can get an idea of the progress you’re making by checking the number of steps taken, the distance you’ve traveled, the calories you’ve burned and so on. You’ll be able to go from one measurement to the next at the press of a button. \n\n7. How Does This Provide Me More Motivation? \n\nThe great thing about wearing a pedometer is that you begin to think about the number of steps you’ve taken towards your daily target.\n\nThis gets you into a ‘walking mindset’ and you suddenly start to identify lots of new walking opportunities. If you had to be dragged kicking and screaming to take up a fitness routine, the pedometer is the single most important device you can use to start enjoying your workouts.\n\nIt’s so easy to use and it can transform the way you feel about getting fit. It can take you from resisting the whole idea of doing a daily workout, to your really looking forward to it and wanting to do it more. Why? Because, after using it for a while, you begin to realize that your daily targets are not only achievable but, with a bit more effort, can be easily surpassed. Something you thought was going to be such a grind becomes easy, because you know you can do it!\n\nDid you ever think that was possible?\n\nWell it is. Just get hold of your pedometer and keep wearing it. It can have a really positive effect on your fitness and health.\n\n(c) 2006 All Rights Reserved"},{title:"It S A Habit",body:"Do you sometimes have the feeling that you’re running into the same obstacles over and over again? Many of my conflicts have the same feel to them, like “Hey, I think I’ve been here before,” but I can’t figure out how I wound up in the same place. The situation is different, but the conflict feels the same. I first read this poem in “The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying” by Sogyal Rinpoche. When I “Googled” it, I found fourteen pages of links. It’s clearly a favorite with many people; I know it speaks volumes to me. “Autobiography in Five Chapters”\n\n1) I walk down the street.\n\nThere is a deep hole in the sidewalk\n\nI fall in.\n\nI am lost . . .

Does this feel familiar? I am ready to learn that lesson! I’m sure that I’ve changed. I can see that hole coming a mile away. This time it will be different. I still end up falling in. Tired, sad and angry, I drag myself up once again. What was I supposed to learn here? I thought I learned that the last time. Some conflicts seem to take years to unravel, but if we stay tuned, and our purpose is to look with curiosity and awareness, we will find the moment when we can step around the hole. As I write, thinking about a recent stumble of my own, I am smiling a bit. From a distance, I watch myself drop into the hole – one I know well – and it’s kind of funny. And perhaps that is the way out – to laugh more often, to “love our mistakes,” as my friend says. I’ve heard it said that eventually we will laugh at all our mistakes – the trick is to laugh sooner. When I can laugh as I climb out of the hole, I’m on my way to finding the route around it, or better yet, that alternate street."},{title:"Harness The Power Of Words In Your Life",body:"Speaking comes to most people as naturally as breathing. On many occasions our words are uttered without conscious thought; in fact we rarely stop and think about what we are saying. Thousands of words pour out of our mouths each day as our thoughts, opinions, judgements and beliefs are freely expressed. Often, however, we are oblivious to the positive or negative effect these words have on ourselves and the people around us.\n\nWords have tremendous power. Words give out energy and a message which creates a reaction in others. Everything you say produces an effect in the world. Whatever you say to someone else will produce some kind of an effect in that person. We are constantly creating something, either positive or negative with our words. Reaction to our words often returns to us often in a multiplied form. For example if I speak words of judgement to a person they will judge me back, probably with more intensity as their judgement has the pain or anger caused by my words attached to it Words of kindness and acceptance will generate a warm and appreciative reaction in a person. That person’s response to the words will be stronger because it will have the emotion created by the words attached to it. The power of words has a ripple effect in our life and those around us.\n\nRecently I came across the work of Dr Emoto, and his studies on water crystals. He took samples of water, froze them and took photographs of the water crystals. He then wrote words on vials of water taken from the same source. The crystals formed in the vials which had positive words, such as love and gratitude, were beautiful. However the crystals in the vials with negative words such as hate and evil were very different, and the water didn’t even form crystals in some instances. Experiments were done using words from different languages, and also by the scientists having no knowledge of what the words meant. The results were similar. More information can be found at http://www.whatthebleep.com/crystals or by watching the movie “What The Bleep Do We Know”. Although I find the concepts of quantum physics difficult to grasp, the findings of this study on water crystals has had a profound impact on me. The human body is known to be composed of up to ninety percent water. If words had such a significant impact on water crystals, then what is the impact of positive and negative words to our bodies?\n\nAn important key to success in life is to understand the power of words. A word is a thought eternalized. Our thoughts do have a great effect on us even though they are internal. What we think effects the way we live our life, it effects our emotions, our attitudes and our behaviour. A thought spoken, however, has even more power. It can never be taken back; it is out of our mouth and will have an effect. Our words have even more power than our thoughts because they not only affect ourselves, but the people and the world around us. Successful people take control of their words, rather than letting their words control them. They are more conscious of their thoughts and words and the power they unleash. Successful people understand that they need to speak positively rather than negatively in order to see success. Successful people are characterized by the words that they speak. They know the importance of speaking words that will build self-esteem and confidence, build relationships and build possibilities. They speak words of affirmation, encouragement, love, acceptance and appreciation.\n\nTo see more personal success, the words that we speak need to be in alignment with what we want to see being produced in our life – our vision and our dreams. Your words can determine your destiny. Even more importantly, your words can make a positive difference on the people you interact with every day. Before you speak ask yourself: Is what I am about to say going to uplift the hearer? Will it inspire, motivate, and create forward momentum for them? Will it dissolve fear and create safety and trust? Will I create a positive or negative ripple effect by speaking out these words? Let’s be determined to unleash the power of words for positive change."},{title:"Effective Hypnosis Quit Smoking Methods",body:"Hypnosis quit smoking methods maintain caused quite a stir in the medical world over the last two decades.

Stretch your imagination and we see wild images of a Freud-like doctor swinging a pocket watch to and fro in front of someone in deep emotional trouble? If so, don’t worry you’re not alone. This is typical movie images and far from reality.\n\nHypnosis, on the contrary, is for all of us the ordinary people. And hypnosis can be used to solve wide-ranging problems. Mind you its not rocket science we cant understand. Each one of us can help ourselves with self-hypnosis.\n\nImagine the problems we face in our lives\n\nWorried about weight loss?\n\nFailed in Love?\n\nBad Marriage?\n\nObesity?\n\nFinding difficult to quite smoking?\n\nLacking confidence\n\nKick drugs?\n\nFear?\n\nStressed out?\n\nSexual problems?\n\nHypnosis is the answer for all problems.\n\nThe world is full of people with myriad personal problems, big & small.

By simply practicing and going into a hypnotic state on a regular basis you can do a world of good for yourself.\n\nLet’s analyze more benefits that hypnosis offers:\n\nHypnosis & Illness – One of the biggest problems people facing today is – STRESS. Stress creates multiple problems – Sleep Disorders, Headaches, and can even increase cholesterol. Hypnosis can help reduce stress, since hypnosis is a state of physical and mental relaxation.\n\nHypnosis & Breath – For a moment, stop reading this and concentrate on your breathing pattern. You’ll be breathing in short quick breaths, this short quick breaths causes stress and tension. More, it can make you feel dizzy, irritable and foggy. With hypnosis you can learn what deep breath is and feel more relaxed and calm\n\nHypnosis and “Feel Good” Chemicals – The brain releases chemicals when you’re in deep relaxed mood.

It is as if your body “learns” how to sleep more peacefully due to the hypnotic state.\n\nHypnosis & Immune System – The other problem of stress is it produced chemicals of the ‘fight or flight’ variety.

With hypnosis you can achieve your goal, feel stronger, more relaxed and will be in a better position to handle your life.\n\nHypnosis is, quite frankly, good for your body PERIOD."},{title:"Hypnosis Myth Reality",body:"Hollywood hype would have us believe that a hypnotist can control and direct our actions, and that we can be made to do all sorts of unimaginable things under hypnosis. Following is a list of some of these common myths which must be clarified before we proceed further.\n\nThe hypnotist can make you do things against your will.\n\nAbsolutely False. The hypnotist has no powers over you at all, and cannot make you do things against your will. All Hypnosis is really self-directed and self-controlled. The hypnotist merely guides you into a hypnotic state, and feeds your mind with carefully worded suggestions. If you feel uncomfortable with these suggestions, you may reject them at will. Hypnosis is essentially a matter of cooperation between the hypnotist and his subject, not some form of power the hypnotist possesses which will compel the subject to submit to his or her will.\n\nOnce under Hypnosis, one can’t come out of the state on his own.\n\nIf you are under hypnosis and the hypnotist suddenly left the room, two things may happen. You will either realize that the hypnotist is no longer talking to you, and will open your eyes, feeling fresh and alert. Or, you may drift into natural sleep, in which case you will wake up after a few minutes (or hours). So, the subject can come out of the trance on his own.\n\nOnly weak-minded people can be hypnotized.\n\nFalse. Hypnosis has nothing to do with will power. People often confuse hypnotibility with gullibility. There is no connection between the two. On the contrary, the more intelligent a person is, the easier it is for him to be hypnotized. To be hypnotized, one needs the abilities of concentration, imagination and vivid visualization.\n\nUnder hypnosis, the subject is totally unconscious.\n\nAt all times during the course of a hypnotic session, you will be able to hear and to think. You are aware of what is going on around you. Although your body is very relaxed, your mind is actually more alert than usual. Many people are worried by stage hypnosis and the fact that the subjects, many of whom do ridiculous things during the session, seem to have no knowledge of anything around them. The unfortunate part of such an activity is that it often frightens away those people who could really benefit from hypnotherapy, but are afraid of losing control.\n\nUnder hypnosis, one can be made to reveal his secrets.\n\nAs mentioned above, under hypnosis, the subject is fully alert, in fact more alert than usual. The hypnotist can only guide the subject to remember forgotten memories. Whether the subject will reveal them to the hypnotist is entirely at his own discretion.\n\nHypnosis is dangerous.\n\nUntrue. It is quite the opposite. Hypnosis is a safe and natural process. One fact that most people are unaware of is that we undergo Hypnosis several times in our daily lives. For example, while driving along a highway, very often, people suddenly discover that they have lost consciousness for several minutes. This is actually an example of momentary hypnotism. However, someone with epilepsy should never be hypnotized.\n\nOne needs special powers to be hypnotized.\n\nAny average person with the willingness and patience to learn, can master the skills of hypnosis. Like other skills such as playing the piano, or learning a foreign language, some people are “naturals”, and become accomplished with little training while others can increase their abilities through regular practice. A good, confident voice is an advantage, but not a must. Of course, children lacking an understanding and appreciation for the subject (usually below the age of 5) may not respond to hypnosis in the desired way.\n\nThe user might become dependent on hypnosis.\n\nYou cannot become dependent upon hypnosis because it has no physical effects on the body. However, many people look forward to their daily hypnosis exercises because they become totally relaxed and awaken refreshed."},{title:"Hypnotherapy For Motivation Getting The Drive Back",body:"Motivation is the key to positivity in our lives. If we were not motivated enough, we would just not have the will in us to go about our daily lives. Its motivation that helps us get through the most mundane things – motivation for working harder, motivation to have a healthy relationship, motivation to earn more, motivation to have a happy family. And yet sometimes we find ourselves lacking in motivation; I think we have all had days when getting out of bed to get ready to go to work seemed like a Herculean task. Sometimes lack of motivation can really bring people down, and hinder their efficiency and ability. This may lead to frustrations and further breakdown of communication between people. However, if you intercept this lack of motivation timely, you have help at hand. Go for hypnotherapy for motivation to get the zest in life back.\n\nHypnotherapy is intrinsically related to the concept of motivation, and can help you in every walk of life. From motivation in sports, to business; from quitting smoking to losing weight, hypnotherapy for motivation could help you out. But here’s the catch: you can think of successfully motivating yourself only once you have your goals identified. Identification of a goal is very necessary before you start motivating yourself. Motivation is all about helping you realize your true potential, sometimes this potential gets thwarted by certain experiences in our lives. Hypnotherapy for motivation works towards removing those mental blockages by connecting with your subconscious.\n\nHypnotherapy is based on the formula of auto suggestion, and it works on deeper levels than one can imagine. Hypnotherapy for motivation converses with your subconscious mind, and urges it to alter self-perception and self – image. Unknown to us, our subconscious is largely responsible for the way we think and react; if we train it to think on a different line, no doubt the accompanying behavior would change too. It understands the true potential that lies within us, and taps into it. Through gentle affirmations such as “I can do it”, it retrains your mind into believing that nothing is impossible.\n\nIn my practice at Oxfordshire, I have helped clients deal with a variety of issues through hypnotherapy for motivation. Some wanted to perform better at work, while others needed motivation to keep a relationship going. Some wanted to perform better at sports, while others at studies. The underlying theory of hypnotherapy is based on motivation, and we need it in every walk of life. However, we need to have our goals clear in our minds for the hypnotherapy to be successful. Hypnotherapy for motivation lets you focus on the particular task at hand, however if the task is undefined, hypnotherapy will be rendered ineffective.\n\nHypnotherapy for motivation can seem to be too simple a solution for these problems; however you will be surprised at their effectiveness. Once you started this journey of self discovery, you will see the changes in a short time. Through altering self-perception and self-image, hypnotherapy gives you a whole new view of the world. From being a procrastinating person, you can go on to become a self starter. So define your goals now, and dive into the vast sea of your subconscious mind through hypnotherapy. The pearls you will find there will take care of every situation and possibility in life. Happy Self Discovery!"
},{title:"Living In The Now Use It To Enrich Your Life",body:"At about this time of year, some months after New Year’s resolutions have been made and kept, or made and neglected, one thing is undeniable: we have a chance to learn and grow every day, no matter what we did not do yesterday or neglected to do last week.  Make Use of This Moment\n\nMaking use of this moment, of the NOW, is a principle that stress management experts, psycho-therapists, meditators, and many authors such as Dr. Wayne Dyer, Jon Kabat-Zinn, and Eckhart Tolle have been talking and writing about for years. \n\nThe only moment, the only life we have is in the NOW. What happened a few moments or several years ago is gone, what will happen this evening, or next month when we go on holidays is not here yet. Thus, if we live our lives thinking about past events or future possibilities, we are literally not living our life.  Developing Flow\n\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi wrote a wonderful little book “Finding Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience” which addresses the issue of the importance of remaining in the moment, of the inestimable value we can find in those activities that cause us to “go into flow”, or lose our sense of time. \n\nWhen you discover what those activities are in your life, they need to be developed. Is it music, writing, or painting, or another creative activity? Is it being outdoors and practicing some kind of sport? Is it working on your computer or editing digital movies? Perhaps you are an avid reader, observer of documentaries about the hunch-backed camel, or participant in the Dakar rally and spend all year preparing. Whatever it is, cultivate it, make it expand in your life, and use it to enrich yourself. These activities are priceless ways of being – and remaining – in the now. \n\nBut that is not all.  Nurture the Now at All Times\n\nBeing in the now needs to be nurtured at all times. The more time you spend in the now, the more you actually live your life. Yesterday – and even just one short hour ago – is gone. Tomorrow is not yet here. Now is what we have. Now is the time of our life. Now is the time for living. Start by gently bringing yourself to this moment more and more often on a daily basis. If you are at work, with your partner or family, or simply running errands, become aware of what you are doing, actually participate consciously in your daily activities … don’t just get through them in order to be able to do something else later on. Doing that means that you have lost this moment forever. Stay in the Now\n\nBy staying in the now, notice how you seem to have more time. Notice how you feel less stressed. Notice all that is potentially enjoyable, positive, or could be a latent learning experience in the now moment. Even if you are going through a difficult situation, remain aware and in the now in order to better understand what is happening and in order to get to know yourself more intimately by observing your feelings, thoughts, and possible reactions. Live here rather than in the past or the future. The more you practice, the more it will become a habit, and the more you will truly live your life, rather than just live on memories of past glories or future hopes and plans."},{title:"Counting Your Chicken Before They Hatch",body:"Have you ever heard the expression, “Do not count your chickens before they hatch?” Maybe an older, wiser individual would tell you this to keep you from getting ahead of yourself. Like buying a new car before you actually got that new job. Well, when setting and obtaining your goals, you need to “Count your chicken before they hatch” in your mind. What I mean by this is you have to start seeing yourself completing or obtaining your goal. What you profess, you possess!\n\nThe first thing you need to do is sit down and set your goals. Diana Scharf Hunt said “Goals are dreams with deadlines.” A lot of times, people are thrown off by the idea of taking the time to set their goals. But when you take a trip, do you not come up with a plan and ultimate destination. Well, setting goals is the same process. I suggest that you first do a Must Have, Why, How analysis. First, write down a list of must haves; bigger home, luxury trips, new cars, work from home, etc. Then decide why these must haves are important to you and prioritize them. Lastly, write down how you are going to get the must haves.\n\nAlso, ask yourself these questions:\n\nWhy do I not have what I want now?\n\nWhat are the tools and resources do I need?\n\nWhat past experiences are in the way?\n\nWho can I talk to that has already succeeded?\n\nHow am I paying for this?\n\nWhat are the tradeoffs?\n\nWhat am I going to give up?\n\nFrom this analysis, start writing down you goals. Remember, without a start, there cannot be an ending. Denis Watley stated “The reason most people never reach their goals is that they do not define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them.” Once finished writing your goals, next you need to start visualizing your dreams. Henry David Thoreau once said “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.” You need image yourself accomplishing your goals and obtaining your treasures. Will yourself into succeeding. Never think that you cannot reach your desired results. Talk about the desires as if you have already obtained it. A good practice is to read your goals daily. If you are having a bad day, read them over and over.\n\nThirdly, you need to get the tools and resources to needed to accomplish your goals. Maybe you have decided to start a home-based business as a mechanism to consummate the acquiring of your dreams. Start gathering documentation on how to run your home-based business. Join service group that might help you. Take the step to start reaching your goals. Kathy Seligman said “You cannot hit a home run unless you step up to the plate. You cannot catch a fish unless you put your line in the water. You cannot reach your goals if you do not try.” Get started today!!\n\nThe fourth point is to surround yourself with like-minded people. In the Bible, Jesus told one of his disciples, “Get behind me Satan.” What he was saying was if you are not with me, you are against me. The same applies to you. Detach yourself from people who are negative towards you goals. If you are going to be rich, why not surround yourself with people who are already rich. David Joseph Schwartz once said “Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success.”\n\nLastly, and most importantly, do not be afraid of success. This phobia is the main reason most people fail. They make no preparation for succeeding. When they succeed, they do not know how to act. People start questioning their success. They start telling themselves that they do not deserve to be successful. And eventually, obtain what they profess. When you are setting your goals, make a plan for being successful. Tell yourself that you deserve to be successful and that you should procure your desires. Catherine Pulsifer best sums this up, “The unfortunate aspect about living life without your own goals is that you may very well reach a point in your life where you will wonder, what would have happened if I had only done…” In closing, the first thing you need to do is start planning and setting your goals. Then you need start visualizing yourself completing your dreams. Also, you will need to get some tools and resources that will help you achieve you goals. And surround yourself with people who are positive and have the same goals as you do. And most importantly, prepare yourself for success. When the time comes, do not be afraid to be successful. Think about this, in the Bible Jesus said, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” You need to start seeing yourself as attaining your goals. Act and talk as if you already have obtained them. Now get started!"},{title:"Does Your Life Lack Meaning",body:"Vera sought out counseling with me because her doctor advised her to discover the emotional causes of her chronic fatigue. Vera, a successful stockbroker, was in a loving 18-year marriage. On the surface, everything in her life was fine. She had enough money, friends, and a good relationship. Yet Vera awoke each morning battling fatigue and depression.\n\nDavid sought my help because of chronic feelings of inner emptiness. David is very successful in his manufacturing business, has a good marriage and two adult children. Like Vera, everything seemed fine. Yet the feelings of inner emptiness drove David to overeat, overspend, and indulge in porno on the Internet.\n\nWhile both Vera and David were successful in their careers, neither loved their work. They worked to make money, but their work had little meaning for them. Yet when they looked inside, neither could discover what did have meaning for them. Both reported that they had never experienced a sense of meaning in their adult lives, and that the emptiness and depression had been with them since adolescence.\n\nAs I worked with Vera and David, it became evident that each had made a decision early in their lives to shut down their feelings to avoid the deep pain of unbearable loneliness. Vera shut down because she was unable to tolerate the loneliness of her mother’s behavior toward her. Her mother would say she loved Vera, but Vera never felt her love. Instead, she felt her mother energetically pulling at her, trying to suck the life out of her. As a very sensitive child, Vera could not tolerate this confusing experience, so she put her feelings in a box and decided to live out of her head instead of her gut.\n\nDavid, also a very sensitive child, shut down because he was unable to tolerate the loneliness of being with two emotionally unavailable empty parents, and the loneliness of rejection from peers.\n\nAs adults, both Vera and David were still shut down from their feelings. They were still afraid of feeling the pain of loneliness – a feeling that is actually an everyday fact of life. Loneliness is present when your heart is closed or another’s heart is closed, or when there is no one with whom to share love. Loneliness is the primary feeling when we want to connect with another and the other is unavailable. If you were completely open to your feelings, you would feel moments of loneliness throughout the day. However, most people never feel this feeling and are completely unaware of it, because the moment there is a twinge of emotional pain, they move instantly to various addictions and addictive behaviors, such as substances, activities, thoughts, shame and blame. Yet when we shut out pain, we also shut out joy and a passionate sense of purpose.\n\nPain and joy are in the same box. Vera and David could not discover what has meaning for them and what brings them joy while keeping a lid on their feelings. And the very act of keeping a lid on their feelings was creating their depression and inner emptiness.\n\nImagine that your feelings are a child within. If you ignore this child – by ignoring your feelings – this child feels abandoned. Our refusal to feel and take responsibility for our own pain is an inner abandonment and results in anxiety, depression, and/or inner emptiness.\n\nIt is our child within – our feeling self – that has the blueprint for what has meaning for us, for our passion and purpose. Each of us comes to this planet with a deep purpose to express, and when we don’t express this purpose, we end up feeling empty and depressed. Yet we cannot discover this purpose when we keep a lid on our feelings.\n\nLearning to manage the pain of loneliness is essential to discovering your passion and purpose. There is no way of managing loneliness without a deep and personal connection to a spiritual source of love and wisdom. We cannot manage loneliness from our mind alone.\n\nYou will find deep meaning in your life when you decide to open to and learn from your feelings of loneliness rather than continue to shut them down. And you will open to these feelings only when you do not feel alone inside due to experiencing the love and wisdom of your spiritual Guidance. Opening to Divine Love and opening to your feelings will bring you the fullness, joy, passion and purpose that are the yearnings of your soul."},{title:"A Starter Guide To Self Improvement",body:"Staying calm, composed and maintaining strong self esteem in today’s tough environment can be difficult but is not impossible if you follow a few simple guidelines. Here are 6 tips you can use as a starter guide to self improvement.\n\nEverything and everyone else around you can affect your self esteem. Other people can deliberately or inadvertently damage your self image. Unchecked people and circumstances can ultimately destroy your self esteem and pull you down in ways you won’t even notice. Don’t let these influences get the best of you. But what should you avoid?\n\n1 : A Negative Work Environment\n\nBeware of a “dog eat dog” environment where everyone else is fighting just to get ahead. This is where non-appreciative people usually thrive and working extra is expected and not rewarded. In this environment no one will appreciate your contributions even if you miss lunch, dinner, and stay at work late into the night. Unless you are very fortunate most of the time you will work too hard with no help from others around you. This type of atmosphere will ruin your self esteem. This is not just healthy competition, at its worst it is brutal and very damaging. 2: Other Peoples Behaviour\n\nBulldozers, brown nosers, gossipmongers, whiners, backstabbers, snipers, people walking wounded, controllers, naggers, complainers, exploders, patronizers, sluffers – whatever you want to call them, all have one thing in common – an overriding desire to prosper at the expense of others. Avoid them and do not be tempted to join them. They may get some short term advantage with their behaviour but deep down most are very insecure, unhappy and ashamed of their behaviour. For most their self esteem disappeared a long time ago. Seeing someone like this prosper is sickening but do not join them – you are better than that!\n\n3: A Changing Environment\n\nIn today’s fast moving society it is difficult if not impossible to avoid change. Changes challenge our paradigms and tests our flexibility, adaptability and alter the way we think. Changes can make your life difficult and may cause stress but, if it’s inevitable, you must accept it, don’t fight it and in time find ways to improve your life. Try to manage change and try to avoid multiple changes at the same time. If a particular change can’t be avoided welcome it. Change will be with us forever, we must learn to live with it.\n\n4: Past Experience\n\nWe all carry “baggage” – past experiences which have moulded us to who we are today, but some people live in their past experiences – usually something that hurt and still hurts. It’s okay to cry out when you experience pain but don’t let pain dominate your life as it will transform itself into fears and phobias. If something painful happens, or has happened to you, find a way to minimise the effects. Discuss it with a friend, a family member or a professional if necessary and move on. Don’t let it continue to dominate your life and dictate your future actions. Because something bad has happened doesn’t mean it will happen again. Learn what you can from any bad experience and move on. 5: Negative World View\n\nThe television news is full of doom and gloom and it is true that around the world there are many people suffering war, famine or other natural or man-made disasters. Whilst I do not suggest you should not care and do nothing, remember that there are many beautiful positive things happening too. Don’t wrap yourself up with all the negative aspects around the world. Learn to look for beauty too for, in building self esteem, we must learn how to be positive in a negative world. 6: Determination Theory\n\nAre we a product of our biological inherited characteristics (nature) or a result of the influences we absorb throughout out lives (nurture)? I believe how we are is due to a mixture of both nurture and nature and as a result our behavioural traits are not fixed. Whilst it is true that some things are dictated by genetics (for example race, color and many inherited conditions) your environment and the people in your life have a major effect on your behaviour. You are your own person, you have your own identity and make your own choices. The characteristics your mother or father display are not your destiny. Learn from other people’s experience, so you don’t suffer the same mistakes.\n\nAre some people are born leaders or positive thinkers? I don’t believe so. Being positive, and staying positive is a choice. Building self esteem and drawing on positive experiences for self improvement is a choice, not a rule or a talent. No-one will come to you and give you permission to build your self esteem and improve your self. It is in your control. It can be hard to keep positive, especially when others and circumstances seem to be conspiring to pull you down. You need to protect yourself and give yourself a chance to stay positive. Improving your self esteem gives you that protection.\n\nOne way to stay positive is to minimise your exposure to harmful influences while using affirmations to boost the positive influences in your life. Constantly reminding yourself of the good things in your life will keep the impact of negative influences to a minimum."},{title:"Discover Your Path To Success Part 4",body:"In Part Three, I promised we would get into the resources. Before we do, however, let’s discuss a treasure that most of us have been exposed to, but don’t take nearly enough time out of our day to focus on – the power of prayer. This may offend some people, but I hope it does not; as that is not my intent.\n\nAs humans, we have progressed in so many ways, but we have lost touch with our bodies, nature, and the power of prayer. There seems to be a spiritual renaissance, of sorts, going on in the “new age” movement.\n\nHowever, there are a large number of children growing up with no spiritual guidance at all. There are many reasons, and excuses, for this, but a large portion of this generation of children could grow up, out of touch, with their spiritual health.\n\nAlways remember that “whole health” deals with mind, body, and spirit, as they are interconnected. If these three components are healthy, you are in good shape at any age.\n\nWhat does this have to do with success? Well, God does make the ultimate ally. Your prayers do honor God’s presence – by giving thanks, and asking for help, in times of need. You will feel much better, and prayer applies to every religion.\n\nPersonally, the importance does not lie in what religion you are; however, a lack of religion does seem to run parallel with depression. This is classified as spiritual illness, which will have a negative effect on you mentally, physically, or totally.\n\nThe concept of God does not apply to all religions, but the concept of prayer does. If you try it, you will heal from the inside – out.\n\nThe following resources start from classics that my Grandfather gave to me as a child.\n\nThe Law of Success, by Napoleon Hill – 1928\n\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie – 1936\n\nThink and Grow Rich, by Napoleon Hill – 1937\n\nThe Power of Positive Thinking, by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale – 1952\n\nAll of these books can be found in audio format, which makes them very handy, especially if you are commuting in your car. Each of these books can also be found on my desk, or in the book case, in my office. Over the years, I had to replace some of the old books my Grandfather gave me, as the worn pages separated from the bindings.\n\nI extend my apologies to the many other great authors, who I did not list; that would be a very large book, within itself. The fact is – this is a good starting point before venturing out and discovering the hidden treasures in print, eBooks, or audio books.\n\nNow you have the last hidden treasures to carve your own path to success. If you put these principles into action, there is no way you can fail. May your journey be a pleasant and safe one."},{title:"Motivation Is The First Step To Success",body:"You will undoubtedly have dreams. Whether you dream of having the perfect house with the perfect car, or you dream of settling down to have a family, even if you dream of retiring by the time you’re 40, the one key to success is doing something about it. It may sound obvious but if you dream of retiring before you reach 40 and yet you aimlessly skip from job to job with no hope of progressing a career, it is very unlikely you will achieve your goal.\n\nSet goals and ambitions and write them down on a piece of paper. Make sure that you are always striving to reach those goals. Sometimes it can be difficult to get the motivation you require in order to succeed at your goals but you can use the goals themselves as the motivation you require. Keep your piece of paper on you and if you are beginning to feel downbeat or skeptical about your goals then look at your piece of paper and remember why you are pushing yourself.\n\nStructuring your life in this way, may seem like it loses its spontaneity but that doesn’t have to be the case. Find a career you like, set up a business, and have fun doing it but always remember that if a good opportunity crops up you should take it with both hands. It is worse not to try something and not know whether it would have been successful than it is to never try anything.\n\nPresuming you have set reasonable goals you should always be able to see a way to fulfill them. If you set goals that are too difficult you will find it incredibly difficult if not completely impossible to meet your goals. You should try not to alter them if possible, however, we don’t know what’s around the corner so we can’t always plan for it. Don’t see this as a failure but take the opportunity to reassess your goals and keep going."},{title:"Motivate Yourself",body:"Why do you want to motivate yourself? Actually, just answering that question fully can be one of the better ways to get your daily motivation. Below are seven more ways that have been provem to work for others. Chances are, some of them will work for you too.\n\nSeven Ways To Motivate Yourself 1. Explain your plans. Usually, by the time I tell my wife about the newsletter I’m going to write, I’m out of my slump and back at the keyboard. Find someone that listens well, and tell them what you want to do. If it is something that you really want, this will almost always get you motivated. 2. Stimulate desire. Imagine the rewards of your effort clearly. Imagination motivates many to sign up for get-rich-quick plans. Good salesmen can have you living in your imagined dream home in minutes, and you’ll feel motivated to do anything to make it real. Just learn to be your own salesman. 3. Use pain. Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) teaches you to link pain with not acting. If you imagine a scene of your kids sitting in jail for drug use – that might motivate you to have that talk you’ve been avoiding. Linking pleasure and rewards to acting is only half of the formula. Remember to link pain to not acting. 4. Develop a true interest. If you have no interest at all, it might mean you need to do something else, but if it’s just a task you dislike, relate it clearly in your mind to the greater goal. I don’t like to drive, but when I remember those mountains I’m going to, I get motivated to drive. 5. Create energy. Coffee can help for a while, but one way or another, you need to have some energy to have motivate yourself. Exercise, sleep well, and watch out for sugary foods – the “sugar blues” will kill your motivation. 6. Have the proper mental state. It’s rare to be depressed and motivated. Resolve some of your negative feelings, and you’ll have more motivation. Another way is to do your important work when you are in a better mood. 7. Make any small step. Commit to raking up one bag of leaves, and soon you’ll want to finish the yard. Any small step towards your goals creates momentum. You have seven ways now, but you have to actually use them, so how do you get motivated to do that? You have to figure that one out yourself. Humor, by the way, can be a good motivator. Laughing often breaks up the feeling of being overwhelmed. There’s your eighth way to motivate yourself."},{title:"Hypnosis Money And 3 Major Motives Of Our Lives",body:"The purpose of all life is development and enrichment. Every Human Being, in fact, every living thing, has an inalienable right to all the development to which it is capable.\n\nA Human Being’s right to life implies his right to have the free and unrestricted access of all things, which may be necessary to assist him realize his fullest mental, spiritual, and physical potential. In other words, every human being has the right to be rich and enjoy everything life has to offer.\n\nThere are three major motives for our lives: We live for our body. We live for our mind. And, we live for our soul. These three constituents are, at the same time, both highly distinctive of each other, as well as highly inter-dependent from each other.\n\nBut, in the world we live in, this is surely easier said than done. Everything we need or want has to be purchased for a price. Life has become so complex that even the most ordinary of human beings needs a great amount of money to satisfy his need for a fuller life.\n\nLiving for the Body\n\nLiving for the body means adequate food, comfortable clothing and shelter; and freedom from undesirable or excessively strenuous work. Rest and recreation are also highly important to our physical well-being.\n\nLiving for the Mind\n\nLiving for the mind implies access to good, thought-provoking books and time to read them, opportunity for travel, for intellectual activities, for observation and analysis, for appreciating works of art, music and beauty. The human mind requires freedom to think creatively and manifest his dreams into reality.\n\nLiving for the Soul\n\nLiving fully for the soul means that one must have the capacity for love and contribution. It is difficult for us to play our roles of a son, a daughter, a father, a mother, a brother, or a sister if we do not have enough money. Ingrained in the concept of love is the sense of giving. The satisfaction one desires out of a spontaneous gesture of giving is worth a fortune. Just as important is to make a meaningful contribution to others among us; to people who have not been as fortunate as we have been. It may be noted that such a contribution need not require a whole lot of money. Even a small contribution (based on one’s capacity and circumstances), which makes a difference in somebody’s life, can provide immense satisfaction to us.\n\nAt the same time, life cannot be treated in a piece-meal manner. Life has to progress as a whole. You cannot leave the body behind, and live merely for the mind. Similarly, you cannot leave the spirit behind, and live merely for the body. All three – Body, Mind and Spirit (or Soul) have to be carried together. As a human being, it is our responsibility to achieve this balance. And, this balance has needs to be fulfilled, for which one needs an adequate amount of money.\n\nHence, it is our inherent right to be rich"},{title:"Learn To Love Growth And Change And You Will Be A Success",body:"Do you want to be even more successful? Learn to love learning and growth. The more effort you put into improving your skills, the bigger the payoff you will get. Realize that things will be hard at first, but the rewards will be worth it. Many of us have to be reminded that almost everything worthwhile in our lives is hard at first. Learning to walk was hard at first, but gradually we learned and now it is effortless. The same holds true for our more advanced skills such as, sports, music, art, etc. We forget these past struggles to learn and take them for granted now.\n\nWhen most people begin to try something for the first time, it usually doesn’t turn out particularly well. It doesn’t mean we are bad, or stupid, or anything like that, it just means that most things of any complexity take awhile to learn. Given this, the surprising thing is how most people react when they begin to learn a new skill and it does not go well. Most people at that point feel such things as surprise, anger, frustration, and so on. We forget that the expression “beginners luck” means that doing something well at first is a fluke. We forget it isn’t supposed to be easy; it is almost against the laws of nature for something to be good at first. \n\nSo what is a more positive way to handle the difficulties we will encounter when we are learning something new?  We should take the attitude that we are supposed to fail at first, that is the way the system works. We should look for a way to find fascination with the process, and build enjoyment of the ups and downs into the process. We need to recognize the difficulties we will face and build them into the time and effort we plan on expending on the project. This is one place in your life where a healthy dose of pessimism will pay off. Just planning for difficulty will take much of the negative emotions we feel in these situations away. \n\nLets look at another situation where we encounter difficulty at first. Almost anything involving change is very hard for us to incorporate into our lives at first. One of my favorite expressions regarding change is “the only kind of change we like, is the change in our pocket.” Making the decision to change is easy, it is just a decision. Staying changed is hard. We want to fall back to our old ways; we are discouraged, uncomfortable and so on. One again we are learning something new and it helps to build this into our plan for change.  In addition to learning to enjoy the process as above, we can add another element to help us through learning something new or the change process. We can keep reviewing the goal we are seeking, the payoff, etc. and continually tell ourselves that the pain is temporary, but the payoff is permanent. We need to take the pain and frustration and deal with it minute by minute, telling ourselves to hang on, hang on, we can make it. Life is a series of minutes we can make it through. \n\nMany people use visualization techniques to help them learn a new skill or deal with change. They “daydream” or use guided imagery to see themselves going through the process of learning or change and attaining the goal. A person on a diet can see himself f becoming thinner and thinner, easing the pain and giving them the sense they can do it. The same with a new skill such as golf. They see themselves hitting the ball, in just the right way, and they see the golf ball going right where they want it. A word of caution regarding using visualization to learn a new skill. The technique is very, very powerful and you will tend to perform exactly like you visualized it, so if you visualize the wrong technique, chances are you will actually perform the wrong technique. So be very sure of the proper technique before you used visualization to help you master it. One last point. I have stressed the need to recognize that new things will be hard to learn at first.  While this “negative” view is helpful, it must be balanced with a positive outlook for the whole project. Plan and expect problems at first, but also plan and expect that you will eventually master the situation. Planning for a positive outcome will help give you the willpower to see the situation through and enable things that are needed to move you ahead to appear when they are needed. Remember if we expect good things, we tend to get good things."
},{title:"Hypnotize Yourself Into The Ghost Of Christmas Future",body:"You will begin to realise why this exercise is called the Dickens Pattern (with reference to the ghost showing Scrooge some different futures) as you notice that the idea of this exercise is to hypnotize yourself to be aware of two very real possibilities for your future. Two distinct pathways that you could take for your life this very day. Have a think about something that you do that you are maybe not motivated to change about yourself. Prior to running through this technique, just have a think about something that you know you need to be doing, but are not. Then with that thing in mind, follow these simple steps. Step One: Get yourself nice and relaxed and settled. Concentrate on your breathing, engage in the moment and spend some time being still, quiet and drift inside of your own mind. Hypnotize yourself here. Step two: Use your imagination to imagine walking down the path of your life. Ok, I know that some of you just cried out “but I can’t visualise!” First up, if you believe you can’t then of course you can’t. Second up, just imagine these things. They do not have to be in cinema screen perfect detail. You can remember what colour what your front door is, right? You can remember what your childhood bedroom is like, right? That is your imagination doing that. You know the sound that your feet make when you walk across gravel don’t you? You can imagine it, but you are not hearing it in your ears, are you? Just imagine these things as best as you can. Failing that, pretend that you are imagining them and that will do the trick. So, as you imagine walking along the path of your life, notice that every step forwards is a minute, an hour or a day into your future. If you look back, you will notice that your past is there; everything you have ever done or experienced is behind you. Become aware of the temperature, the sights, the sounds and enjoy walking along the path of your life. Make it sensory rich and get comfortable with the idea. Imagine the feeling of your feet walking along the path and the sound they make. Engage with the idea of really being there. Step Three: Imagine that a few more steps ahead there is a place where the path splits, where is goes off to the left and off to the right. Pause here for a few moments and have a think. Here, there are two different pathways, two possibilities, two ways that you could choose to go. If you were to choose the path to the left, life is pretty much the same as it is. You carry on doing the same things, living the same way and dealing with this thing in the same way as you have been doing. If you were choose the path to the right, the right path, there are new possibilities, achievement, freedom of mind, positive and progressive implications. Think about that as you stand at this place where the path splits. You want to make a decision and commit to one of these paths. Before you make that decision, we are going to see what each path holds for your future. \n\nStep Four: Step out on to the path to your left. Where there is no change. Briefly imagine that you are not going to live and discover your unfulfilled dreams. Instead, you continue doing what you have in the past. What will life be like in 10 years time? Step out, every step you take you get older, days pass, weeks pass. Notice how your body is, how your mind is, how you feel about staying on this path. Walk out into your future to the 10 year point. Walk out 10 years into your future and feel how it feels to carry on doing the same thing. This path is just like today, with one difference: you have 10 fewer years remaining in your life. I want you to think about how you will feel in 10 years if you continue doing the exact same things you have done to date. What will your daily life be like?\n\nReally experience that. See what you see, hear what you hear, feel the feelings. Disappointment? Anger? Frustration? Failure? How does that feel? How do you affect those around you? How do they feel? Absorb every aspect of this path that you can take today if you so choose. Notice everything that you need to know about what it will be like if you carry on with the same behaviour, putting off change. Drift back to where the path splits. Step Five: Now take a step out on to the path to the right. This is where you create powerful, progressive change. Notice the sense of freedom in your thoughts, the sense of accomplishment and walk out 10 years into your future. Imagine you are 10 years into the future but this time it’s different. Why? Because starting today you actually begin making changes in your life. Specific intentional changes are not easy. They are intentional because these changes are changes that you are choosing and they are the changes that will cause you to live the life you want to live and dream. They often mean leaving the perception of security in order to discover your personal freedom. These are the changes that will bring happiness and satisfaction into your life. Just go there now. 10 years out… having made a decade of changes. Imagine living the life you want to live. How does that feel inside? Do you feel that you have lived life? See the people of your life and how they feel about you and how they react to you. This is the path of a different choice, a different decision. You have the freedom to be how you want to be. Absorb all you need from this moment in your future and the positive things that you can learn consciously and unconsciously and then drift and float back to the place where the path splits. Step Six: Now that you know and have experienced the two contrasting futures. Now that you know what your future holds as a result of what you do this very day, you can make a decision. You can compare and contrast those two futures that can be yours based on a decision that you make about how you are going to live your life.\n\nImagine reaching deep inside you for all the strength and wisdom that you need to make this decision today. As you do so, imagine that when you choose to make that decision that deep inside your mind you are switching off the alternative path, you are switching off the opportunity to drift back to that place. Then step out and take your future path. Absorb yourself in the sensations, the feelings, the sights, the sounds and of course continue to engage in your future the way I have discussed in previous articles on this blog. \n\nStep Seven: Open your eyes and begin to plan your future and take action to achieve that outcome. Your unconscious mind now knows what it is working towards.\n\nWhat is the exact sequence of events that will take you to where you want to be? Have a think consciously of what you need to do. Every outcome begins with the first step. When you decide you want to have a romantic meal for two, there are many steps that you need to perform in order for that to happen. (Check the fridge, do you have what you want to serve up? No? Find keys, open garage door, drive car to the supermarket etc. etc.) You need to determine the exact sequence of events and write it down. Begin with the outcome in mind. Write without stopping. 10 years from now, I plan to be living in a… at…. With…. Get really detailed about it. Why? Because you are hooking up the neural connections in your brain. You must improve upon, clarify and make clear just exactly who and what you are going to be doing, experiencing, living and having in 10 years. This is the first step of the process! Key: Notice how you felt excited and optimistic when you did this? The reason is simple. It’s the life you are designing instead of the one that was given you and that you have lived with less intention and purpose to date.\n\nThis is the beginning of creating the life that you want to live. Know what the future holds for you as a result of the choice you can make today. \n\nHave some fun and hypnotize yourself to be your very own “Ghost of Christmas future” and see what the future holds for you."},{title:"Control Your Own Level Of Motivation",body:"When I first mention this to most people, they really don’t get it, so here is a simple formula for keeping your moods upbeat.\n\nAudio books and music can be used as tools for motivation. The audio book is such a great motivational and learning tool, while you are commuting, or just out for a drive by yourself. I mention “by yourself” because, ideally, you should spend quality time with people in your car.\n\nYou can learn so much about life and a self-improvement audio book can keep you motivated all day long.\n\nWhen I first started listening to audio books it was during commuter traffic through Providence and Boston. I would show up to meetings relaxed, with fresh ideas, and motivated. When people asked me the secret, I told them about the magic of audio books.\n\nMost of them never asked me again, thought I was some strange eternal optimist, and never bothered to try an audio book.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are slaves to stress, and don’t want to change anything. They go about their lives with a perfect recipe for a heart attack and high blood pressure.\n\nHere is the ultimate recipe for a very sad and short life. You must combine “running late” to work, high volume traffic, the daily latte, a high stress job, and show up barely on time or late.\n\nSome people are, what I call, “mad at the world.” They drive from one intersection to the next, making gestures at everyone. Some of these people can be helped, while others go through a daily cycle of frustration and even invite violence.\n\nNow, let’s get back to you. As long as you stay aware, you have control over your motivation, moods, and level of optimism. So, take charge by plugging yourself into positive energy with books, audio books, music, and positive people."},{title:"How To Stop Living Your Life On Autopilot",body:"If you find yourself doing the same routine day after day, never remembering what you did the day before, having nothing to look forward to, living your life – but never enjoying it or anything in it…you are probably living your life and the relationships in it on autopilot. \n\nThe really devastating part about living life on autopilot, especially when it comes to your relationships, is that you don’t even know that you’re doing it half the time. You’re just living your life, wishing for more, but not really sure if there is more or how to get it. While many people live out their entire lives on autopilot (which is truly sad), the way to have truly rewarding and successful lives & relationships is to be totally aware and adaptable when it comes to life. So, how do you do that?\n\n1. Stop and smell the roses (literally:). Take time to notice all the little things around you that you always use to look at when you were 6! 2. Think about your short and long-term goals. Do you still have those? And if so – have you forgotten them? Re-write that list and start working on accomplishing your next short-term goal.\n\n3. Remember your relationship? When was the last time you did something new with him/her? When was the last time you even wanted to? Start thinking about your relationship and stop just “being in it”.\n\n4. Finally, if you are on autopilot there’s a reason why. Your life is out of balance. It’s either too stressful, too complicated, too boring, or you have surrendered your life to the “routine”.  Take one day this week and really think about your life. Your relationship. How can you shake things up? Make them interesting? How can you get back in balance and in love with your life again?

As the implications of helping those with negative self-esteem, depression and anxiety are immense this is certainly an area of research that deserves a great deal of attention. Psychology Online reports on a study investigating the differences between INTERNAL and EXTERNAL MOTIVATION. The report states that “Although our society is largely extrinsically-motivated by external rewards such as money, fame and power, research has indicated those who are intrinsically-motivated by inner desires for creativity, fulfillment and inner satisfaction are psychologically healthier and happier.” How can this help you? The study of health psychology seeks to understand how our ability to cope with stress can help us to prevent illness and promote health. Some of these coping mechanisms are naturally inborn but may be taught to those who lack them. Motivation is one of the tools that researchers are trying to use as a combatant of negative stress reactions. Motivation is something that we use every day. It’s what enables us to survive – to get food because we’re hungry, to go to work to pay the bills or to educate ourselves in order to pursue a higher goal in life. How we respond to life’s demands can affect our overall health. How are you classified? The same report on Psychology Online identified those who respond to life with negativity or anxiety as most likely to deal with the physical affects of anger, guilt, nervousness, frustration and fear. These emotions can cause hypertension and high blood pressure which can lead to heart attack or stroke. Other complications include ulcers, arthritis, asthma and kidney disease. Some therapists suggest that by using positive self-talk and trying to restructure the WAY we look at events can offset the physical and mental effects of dealing with negative or stressful events in life. Interestingly, people who tend to focus on themselves as the controller of their fate – in fact ‘self-motivated’ – are more likely to feel a sense of control when stressors affect them. Instead of blaming something or someone else they have the motivation to deal with a problem and look for a reasonable solution. This positive behavior helps them to achieve goals and find personal contentment. Therapists try to teach patients how to emulate this positive reaction to stress and use their motivation as a source of empowerment. Learning to manage stress and using motivation to set goals, work through a problem or fix it can in turn promote better mental and physical health."},{title:"Fire Up Your Motivation",body:"You should be able to find several indispensable facts about motivation in the following paragraphs. If there’s at least one fact you didn’t know before, imagine the difference it might make. It’s so difficult to go on when everything seems to fail, isn’t it? Are there times in your life when you really want to call it “quits” because you just can’t see any good results from all the hard work you’ve done?\n\nHold your horses!\n\nNever ever think of giving up. Winners never quit and quitters never win. Take all negative words out of your mental dictionary and focus on the solutions with utmost conviction and patience. The battle is never lost until you’ve abandon your vision.\n\nBut what if you’re really exhausted physically, mentally, and most of all emotionally? Here are some sources of motivation to prompt you in reaching the peak of accomplishment.\n\n1) The Overwhelming Feeling of Attaining your Desired End\n\nHow would you feel after accomplishing your mission? Of course you will feel ecstatic. You might be shedding tears of joy. Let this tremendous feeling sink in and encourage you to persist despite all odds.\n\nWhen I was studying for the Board Exams, I used this technique to motivate me. I would envision the sweetness of folks calling me a CPA. It would command respect. People will look up to me as a higher level of authority. And I would have better chances of finding a good job. I absorbed all these great perceptions into my inner being in order to achieve my ultimate goal. 2) The Reward System\n\nHow would you feel if you’ve entered a contest, but there are no prizes for the winners? It’s not very encouraging, isn’t it?\n\nThe same principles apply to your vision. Reward yourself after accomplishing a goal. Set a particular incentive for every objective.\n\nLet’s say if you’ve achieved a particular task, you’ll treat yourself to your favorite restaurant. When you’ve finished a bigger task, you’ll go on a vacation. Got the idea?\n\nJust set something gratifying to indulge in after completing a certain undertaking. The best time to learn about motivation is before you’re in the thick of things. Wise readers will keep reading to earn some valuable motivation experience while it’s still free. 3) The Powerful Force of Humanity\n\nIf you want to succeed, surround yourself with the right kind of people who will support and encourage you all the way.\n\nBe with people who have the same beliefs and aspirations as yours. Positive aura is generated by this fusion of collective energy from people of “like minds.”\n\nOn the contrary, being with people who oppose your ways of thinking may trigger a negative, yet very powerful, kind of motivation.\n\nHas anyone ever said to you that “You’ll never get anywhere” or “You’re wasting your time with what you’re doing?”\n\nDidn’t it made you furious and determined enough to prove to them how wrong they were? This is what I’m talking about.\n\nWhen aggravated, you will do anything to make those who are against you swallow their words. But of course, your main focus should be on the accomplishment of your goal and not for the purpose of revenge. Never let your emotions toward others alter your main objective.\n\n4) Take Care Of Your Health\n\nExercise regularly. Fill your brains with enough oxygen to allow you to do your daily tasks with more vigor and energy.\n\nTake regular breaks if time allows. Having the will power to continue despite all hardships is extremely important, but you should still know your limits.\n\nIf you don’t take enough rest, you will not be able to think clearly and you will not be able to do your tasks properly. In the process, you will just get more frustrated. Take sufficient sleep and recharge yourself after a hard day’s work. Never, ever ignore your health. I’ve learned my lesson when I sacrificed my health for the sake of success. I’ve worked very long hours everyday and just got minimal sleep. As a result, I became ill.\n\nIt’s not worth it. Success won’t matter if you don’t have good health to enjoy it.\n\nFire up your motivation and live life to the fullest!\n\nThat’s how things stand right now. Keep in mind that any subject can change over time, so be sure you keep up with the latest news. superstar@sandgmarkting.com"},{title:"A World Of Infinite Opportunities",body:"Many people feel that there is a limited amount of abundance, wealth, or chances to succeed in life. Furthermore, there is a solid belief that if one person succeeds, another must fail.  \n\nThis might be true, in some cases, such as in a small company or school, where opportunity is limited by management. However, the world is a big place, and there are opportunities created from ideas that help people, and no one gets hurt in the process. \n\nBelow are two examples of success that have not taken anything away from anyone: \n\nDanny Thomas: With his promise, prayers, and vision, for St. Jude’s Hospital, he received the help of friends in the Arab-American community to build a fantastic charity. Some of us also believe he received divine help – I know, I do.  \n\nThere is much more to this story, but what did this hospital or charity take away from anyone? Aren’t the children who recover from cancer living proof that this idea, and prosperity, is for the pure benefit of mankind? There is no one who is hurt by this, and Marlo Thomas has picked up where her father left off. \n\nYoga teachers: Many unfulfilled members of the workforce have left their jobs to teach the benefits of Yoga to the masses. They teach their students to enjoy life, deal with stress, breathe properly, improve their posture, become aware of their bodies, and many more benefits. \n\nMost Yoga teachers believe that all of the great Yoga jobs are in health clubs, ashrams, and Yoga studios. Not so, in my book “How to Grow Your Own Successful Yoga Business,” I mention 16 ways to start up with little or no overhead.  \n\nWithin the first chapter, there are Yoga teaching opportunities that currently exist with little, or no, competition. Yoga teachers who have taken this advice have become successful and prosperous. \n\nDo these jobs take food away from anyone? When someone starts a business, do they take food away from another competitor? If you believe your competition is your problem, it will be. This is limited thinking, and you have to learn to think “outside the box,” in order to be successful in life.  \n\nDon’t waste time on bad thoughts. You can easily co-exist in harmony with them, become friends, and learn from them. There is enough opportunity for everyone. This should be your mantra: Observe your competition, learn from their mistakes, and when possible, copy their success.    This is why you need to take a mandatory vacation and get fresh ideas. This is why you should take a notebook with you. I still prefer the “old fashioned,” spiral bound notebook, with a pen in hand.

A farmer hears tales of diamonds and begins dreaming of vast riches. He sells his farm and hikes off over the horizon, never to be heard from again. Rumors say that years later he died destitute, never having found the diamonds he spent his life seeking. Meanwhile, the man who bought that farm found a large and “interesting looking” stone in a stream that ran through the property. He put the stone on his mantle where a visitor recognized the large stone as a rough diamond. It turned out to be the Hope Diamond, the largest such stone ever found. That stream bed was littered with diamonds, and the new owner became fabulously wealthy. No doubt he also lived happily ever after. But doesn’t something in that story set strangely with you? What about the guy with the burning desire and the grand vision? He ended up disappointed and broke, dying far from his family and friends. Not a happy ending. Meanwhile, the guy who just wanted to do some farming got all the riches. Make no mistake, the new owner already had money, or he could not have bought the land. There’s nothing in this story to make us think he was dreaming about riches, vast or otherwise. No burning desire. But he got the goodies.\n\nWas this just another little prank, courtesy of a mischievous Universe? Or is it possible to get good things coming your way with only mild desire — maybe even a calm indifference? Many inspirational writers, including Napoleon Hill, have assured us that a burning desire is one of the prerequisites of acquiring a fortune. I’ve even said it myself, although I added the qualifier that the powerful desire is not so much for the Universe. It’s for you, to help you overcome and battle past your own doubts and resistances. But haven’t you seen people who seem to coast into good things, like the farmer who found the Hope Diamond? I’ve known people like that. In fact, after I’d been in Japan for a while and had set up a “channel” for business to flow through, I could just think about receiving more money, and I’d get an immediate surge of business within hours. This pattern went on for 16 or 17 years, till I shut down my writing and editing business. So it wasn’t an occasional fluke. Now, I must admit I had a burning determination to stay in Japan, and for the first year or two I never knew if things would work out for me or not. Then, things started shifting my way, and they stayed that way. Why? Truthfully, I don’t think the deciding factor was the desire. Lots of people come here to Japan, but never quite find out how to stay. Many, many foreigners who come here end up losing their toehold and slinking back home. On the other hand, the ones who do stay are often not especially hard working, dedicated, sensible or qualified. More than one long-time English teacher or copywriter remains here because they enjoy the hard drinking culture, the many women who like foreigners, or the feel of being a round peg in a square hole. Achieving their dream doesn’t appear to have a lot to do with burning desire. Instead, it seems to be more a matter of what they can allow themselves to have. Some people call this a sense of deserving. Others call it a sense of entitlement. No matter what term you use, it’s basically the same thing. Either way, it’s governed by who you think you are and what circumstances you accept as appropriate for you. In other words, it all starts from who you are in your own mind."},{title:"Discover Little Known Secrets For Successful Living",body:"Being lucky in life is the result of putting yourself into action for good luck to happen to you. You’ve probably heard the statement “The harder I work the luckier I get”. Another way of putting it is “Whatever you are ready for is ready for you.”\n\nAre you satisfied with your life, the job you have, or the amount of money you’re making? Or are you not satisfied with the feeling that life is somehow passing you by? Chances are one of these reasons fits you because most people aren’t satisfied with their lives, and usually one of those reasons is the cause.\n\nSuccess is not a spectator sport, something that just happens before your eyes. It’s an experience, a game that must be played to be enjoyed fully. You need to get involved with life. You’ll need to get more involved with your family, friends, people you see every day. Because in that involvement, you’ll find you have everything you need to succeed.\n\nYou have within you, right now, at this very moment, all that is necessary for you to become the happy, successful person you’ve always wanted to be. All you need to do is unlock the riches that have been locked away with-in you.\n\nAre you ready for a more abundant and happier life? If you are, then you’ll need to know how to put yourself into action to achieve it. Consider these discoveries for successful living:      "},{title:"Burn The Ships",body:"One of the keys to reaching your goals is to eliminate any escape routes. It is tempting to retreat to safety and comfort when challenges and difficulties arise. To avoid turning around and abandoning your goals, you must make going forward more compelling then going back.\n\nWhen striving towards a goal, you must focus on what you want to obtain and avoid the impulse to go back to what you know and to what is comfortable. When Spanish Conquistador Hernando Cortez landed in Mexico, one of his first orders to his men was to burn the ships. Cortez was committed to his mission and did not want to allow himself or his men the option of going back to Spain. By removing this option, Cortez and his men were forced to focus on how they could make the mission successful.\n\nEliminating an escape route creates a compelling reason to focus on the goal and to keep moving forward. However, it is important to keep in mind that although Cortez had his men burn the ships, he did not have them burn the food and supplies. Cutting off an escape route to increase motivation and create the desire to press on where you might otherwise give up is totally different from throwing caution to the wind and taking undue risks. Reaching your goals still requires prudent planning and managing. All goals contain a certain degree of risk, but it isn’t necessary to create undue risk and stress by not properly planning and thus lacking the necessary tools and supplies to achieve your goal. Take risks, but don’t be careless or foolish and simply hope that everything will be okay.\n\nBefore you decide to burn your ships, make sure you have the supplies and tools necessary to achieve the goal. Something like quitting your job might sound like a good way to close the escape route, but it might also be a fast way to bankruptcy if you don’t have resources to carry you through. Creating a savings account balance or having a journey job (a job that is a stepping stone to what you really want) allows you to take the risk of leaving your current job without creating undue risk. I once took a six-month leave of absence from a job while I was deciding if I wanted to move to a different state. Although it was difficult making the transition as I was very homesick, once I found a job in my new location, I resigned from the job I had waiting for me because I knew it would be too tempting to go back.\n\nClose off the escape routes and make sure that you have a compelling reason to move forward. However, at the same time, make sure that you plan for the risk and have the tools, supplies and resources you need to achieve your goals. You can’t eliminate risk but you can plan for it. Don’t just jump in without thinking through the process and having a solid plan for moving forward."},{title:"Self Motivation How To Keep Yourself Motivated",body:"Keeping one’s self going is a difficult thing to do. There are a million distractions that occur every day and that can mean that we do not stay on track with what we should be doing. Self-motivation is something that does not come easy to a lot of people and that means that there are some steps that need to be taken before you can become motivated to the fullest extent. Of course there are some other matters that first need to be taken care of. If there are a lot of distractions that keep you from doing what you need to be doing then you need to make some changes. This is really the first step towards becoming self-motivated in any form.\n\nTo be self-motivated means that there is no outside force or person pushing you to become what you want. The whole concept of succeeding lies within yourself and that means that you will need to make the effort yourself to be who you want to be. The doing away with the distractions means that you need to be completely self-reliant. If you have many distractions then you will not be getting the things done that need to be so you are not being self-motivated in that sense. Take the effort to make sure that you are completely absorbed in what you are doing, especially when it comes to work. This will mean that everything else takes a back seat and you are working to the best of your ability.\n\nIf you are a person that needs a push to get going on something then you will need to devise a plan to become self-motivated. If you are one that requires the motivation then you will need to be sure to have something nearby that reminds you of what you need to be doing. For instance, a photograph depicting an event will be sure to move you along whenever you look at it. The same goes for a saying by a famous person that has succeeded in the way that you wish to succeed. \n\nTo be self-motivated is to be the one person that gets it done without having to be told to do so. Moving along through the ranks and being the one person that succeeds where others fail is above all the rest. Take the time to become self-motivated and you will be much happier with yourself to say the least."},{title:"Use Your Reset Button To Change Your Vibration",body:"At every moment you can tell if the vibration that you are sending is either a positive one or a negative one by identifying the feeling you are experiencing. At every moment you have a feeling and that feeling is causing you to emit or send off a vibration – and in the ‘vibrational’ world there are only two kinds of vibrations; positive or negative. So as you talk about what you don’t want and make negative declarative statements, in that moment you are sending out and emitting a negative vibration. Law of Attraction then matches it by giving you more of the same.\n\nYou can reset your vibration from a negative one to a positive one by simply choosing different words and different thoughts. It’s as easy as asking yourself, “So what do I want?” As I’ve said before, when you talk about what you don’t want and then talk about what you do want the words change. When the words change the vibration changes and you can only hold one vibration at a time. In other words, you are resetting your vibration. The best news of all is that the Law of Attraction doesn’t remember what vibration you were sending out five minutes ago, five days ago, five months ago or 50 years ago. And the Law of Attraction doesn’t keep score of how long you may have been sending out or emitting a vibration. It’s only checking on the vibration you are offering right now in this very moment and matching it with more of the same.\n\nRemember, the Law of Attraction always matches vibrations in the current moment (hence the expression, the point of power is in the present.) You are always at choice as to whether you want to reset your vibration or keep it as it is. If you like what you’re getting, celebrate it and in your celebration you’ll get more of the same from the Law of Attraction. If you don’t like what you are getting, use your reset button to change your vibration which will change the results you are experiencing."
},{title:"Re Commit",body:"Any time we start something new it is exciting and we are very motivated and committed. As time goes by, however, the burst of enthusiasm can wane as the reality of how much work is going to be involved kicks in. When you find yourself slacking a little and not being as enthused about the new change or goal you are working towards, that isn’t a sign to quit. It is a sign that it is time to re-commit.\n\nI am in the fourth month of my “New Program” of eating right and exercise. The first three months I was excited, enthused and rearing to go. However, I have found that the last month has been a tad more challenging and I have begun to slip a bit in my new exercise and eating habits. As I waned so did my results, which made me think it wasn’t working. Closer examination revealed that it wasn’t the system that wasn’t working; any system will work if you work it. But, it isn’t magic. It takes effort and, most of all, commitment. When I realized that my commitment had slipped I recommitted and got back on track. This is all part of the process and I don’t see my temporary slide in commitment as a failure. I see it as an opportunity to strengthen my resolve and continue on the journey.\n\nThe more you renew your commitment the stronger it will be. Commitment isn’t a magic pill, take it once and you’ve got it. Commitment is something that needs to be tended to, adjusted and strengthened. I have begun to renew my commitment every day, which helps to remind me how much I really want to make this change work and stick. You might not have to renew your commitment as often, but it does pay to check in and see where you are on the commitment scale. If you notice that you are not where you want to be with your goals it might just be that it is time to renew your commitment."},{title:"Enhance Your Life By Having A Sense Of Purpose",body:"Researchers believe that developing A SENSE OF PURPOSE is a strategy which can ENHANCE HEALTHY LIVING.The basis for their theory comes from studies carried out on 135 women in the age group 61-91.This groups EMOTIONAL and PHYSICAL WELL BEING were evaluated by rating two types of indicators.\n\nHAPPINESS evoked by POSITIVE experiences and A SENSE OF PURPOSEand a high SELF ESTEEM and REWARDING RELATIONSHIPS.\n\nResults indicated that those who had A SENSE OF PURPOSE also displayed better PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING ABILITY. They had a tendency to weigh less, had a lower level of inflammatory cytokines which increase the risk of arthritis, displayed evidence of better SLEEP PATTERNS, lower blood sugar levels and HDL levels(good cholesterol) was more apparent. In the group which only displayed HAPPINESS the benefit was only that of a lowered cholesterol level.\n\nWhat is A SENSE OF PURPOSE? There are many definitions.\n\nHaving an influence over others in work, in your community, within a family setting, or on a wider basis.(OXFAM, HELP THE CHILDREN, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL.)\n\nBeing recognised and VALUED for your contribution. This also implies being VALUED by yourself!\n\nBeing RESPECTED by others.\n\nHaving A SENSE OF IDENTITY.\n\nRecognising a sense of ACHIEVEMENT from what you do.\n\nHaving A PURPOSE helps to build CONFIDENCE and SELF ESTEEM.People who lack PURPOSE are often unhappy and lonely.\n\nExamples of this could be the person who has retired from work. He may well have lots of time on his hands and be involved in a range of recreational activities but remain unfulfilled as there is no SENSE OF PURPOSE. Involvement in these pursuits simply helps to put in his day.\n\nHow often have you thought about what you would buy or the problems that may be solved by a lottery win? Yes, we have all dreamt about this and there is nothing wrong with having DREAMS .They can open up our minds to possibilities and sometimes lead us to pursuing GOALS and a course of ACTION in their pursuit.\n\nYet, how often do we hear about people who have had this stroke of luck and discoverthat their lives are not necessarily enhanced in any meaningful way by this, or are even worse of because of it. Headlines in local press have told us about the families who have broken up after winning money. People who have packed in their jobs and gone on shopping sprees and drinking binges. Men and women who long for the company of others who are not solely interested in them for what they get. The world in our eyes may be their oyster but what they may find diminished is a sense of CHALLENGE…\n\nThere is some truth in the saying that if you have to work hard for something you will appreciate it more.Sometimes the achievement itself is not the most rewarding aspect, but the process involved in its acquisition.\n\nWhat provides someone with A SENSE OF PURPOSE will vary from person to person. For some it may simply be taking care of another close to them. Others may choose to travel, get involved in regular EXERCISE/HEALTHY EATING, doing college courses. The options are limitless. Which ever you choose, your commitment to this will also benefit you by keeping your MIND ACTIVE.\n\nThe chances are that he/she will also be more OPTIMISTIC and HOPEFUL as a person .Having something important to aim for encourages people to be less likely to give up when things go wrong and to look for any learning opportunity instead.\n\nHaving A SENSE OF PURPOSE tends to make people more involved in taking care of themselves. They will pay attention to their health. Involvement with other people means that they are less LONELY and that they also have other people around for support. Peers can also be useful for giving you feedback and helping you see things about yourself which may otherwise go unnoticed."},{title:"Motivation In Life",body:"So many of us are demotivated to achieve anything. Such people are not enthusiastic about anything. They don’t want to work towards any goal. Nothing motivates them to work. Why is it so? Why many of us are not motivated? What is wrong?\n\nWe think in different ways and our thinking is decided by many factors. Some are known and some are unknown. The known factors are – thinking, circumstances, early upbringing, living style, culture, family support, friends, own intelligence etc. Our thoughts and our mental makeup is also decided by many factors that are yet not known. Two persons of similar upbringing may be facing similar situation, but react in opposite ways? there are so many whys about the human mind that it is very difficult to determine about what may happen. \n\nComing back to the central question – why are some of us totally demotivated? There is no easy answer. Can anything be done to propel such people towards work? Can one do anything to make them enthusiastitic about anything, so that they begin working towards it? \n\nTake your own example. You are motivated to do one thing, but totally demotivated by something else. A mathematician may get very excited looking at a Math problem, but remain unaffected by the greatest pieces of music? Why? The musician acts exactly opposite, or may get equally excited by maths problem and music. Why? Our mind is a complex structure, about which we ourselves don’t know much. How many of us can claim to know about their own mind? They may know about thier abilities and disabilities, their likes and dislikes, etc. but can they predict about their own reaction in a situation? very difficult. One has to find one’s own answers in such situations. One has to reflect himself/herself and decide about the action that can be taken to break the unmotivated state. Friends, family and even medical science can help one to a certain extent, but the final destination has to be reached by the person on his/her own.\n\nIf at anytime, you notice that a friend of yours is getting demotivated about life, try to inspire him/her as much as you can. Even if you are physically away from your friend you can send him inspirational ecards and tell him to download motivational screensavers and wallpapers. So motivate everyone who needs the boost."},{title:"Do Dreams Serve As A Premonition",body:"Being able to foresee an unfortunate fact of life like death, disasters, illnesses, etc. through a dream is very common. Anyone may dream of something good or bad happening to someone else or even to themselves. Do dreams serve as a premonition?\n\nBefore we proceed in answering the question, let me first give you the definition of premonition and dreams. Based on dictionary meaning a PREMONITION is a presentiment of the future; or a warning in advance while a DREAM is a series of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations occurring involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep; a wild fancy or hope or a reverie.\n\nLet us first talk about dreams. We all know that dreams do play a role in our daily lives. The majority of people pay little attention to dreams. Dreams can help us find solutions to our daily problems and see things from a different perspective. Whenever we are dreaming, we can be who or what we want to be, regardless of the fact that in real life, sometimes it cannot be. Dreams have their own interpretation, like for example when you dream about loose, rotten, or missing teeth, it indicates that a family member or close friend is very sick or even near death. You can learn of your dream’s meaning through a Dictionary of Dreams.\n\nNow, what about premonitions? As defined earlier, it may be a warning in advance. A lot of people have had premonitions in different types of situations. When we say premonition, it is conveyed through dreams. A certain foreboding of what will happen in the near future but in a vague sense. Many cases of premonitions were documented like the disaster when Titanic sank and killed a lot of people, wherein there were fifty counts of premonitions. Some of the passengers who had a premonition cancelled their tickets before riding the Titanic, were saved from the horrible disaster that took place in 1912.\n\nDo dreams serve as a premonition?\n\nWell, it actually depends on the dream itself. If a person dreams about the whole scenario of an event, it can or may happen in the future. Yet, in another view, it can be just a dream that he had had but has a different significant meaning for it. A dream can serve as a premonition yet at the same time it also cannot be.\n\nWe could say that a dream served as a premonition when the dream itself foretold something that could happen in real life. But, if your dream was something out of a grandiose anticipation of what you have been thinking of, it may be just from your subconscious mind. My answer to the question “Do dreams serve as a premonition?” is IT DEPENDS, whether the dream you had has something to do with what could happen or maybe just out of a wishful thinking sense that your subconscious mind revealed through a dream."},{title:"Winner S Gold From Personal Garbage",body:"Have you noticed how everybody takes it for granted a bad experience is automatically, unreservedly, unremittingly bad? That nothing good could ever come from a bad childhood, for example? I’m hearing the comment more and more often that we have become a victim society. Maybe this is true? Consider…\n\nDon’t we hear these comments a lot? I was mistreated when I was a child… I was a lonely latchkey kid… My ancestors got a bad break, so I’m… I lived in a poor, disadvantaged family… I grew up in a broken home… I didn’t get the proper advantages… I was constantly criticized as a child…\n\nEvery one of these comments sounds a lot like self-pity, like “I can’t be helped because I’ve been scarred beyond reclaim.” Well, maybe all of the bare facts are true, but isn’t it time to start looking for the positives that are buried in all that negative stuff?\n\nExample: I was mistreated when I was a child… …and as a result, I learned to be a survivor and to resist all efforts to crush my spirit. Sure I had some hard times back then, but now, I’m both tough and sensitive. I didn’t learn self esteem then, but I’ve learned it as an adult, and I understand people better for it.\n\nExample: I was a latchkey kid… …and everyone treated me like an abandoned orphan. But it was great. My dad and mom fought all the time, so coming home to a quiet house was a wonderful break, and I loved it.\n\nSee what I’m getting at here? You have the right to take any piece of your personal history and reinterpret it to your advantage rather than to your detriment. You can find ways to turn your past to your own good.\n\nStudies have shown that many children who grow up insecure tend to be unusually self-reliant as adults.\n\nYou don’t HAVE to be filled with resentment, anger or helplessness. You COULD choose to feel something more pleasant, at least part of the time. And if you did choose to feel better about yourself, what do you think the result might be?\n\nDid you know this is what many of the most successful people do? If they have a terrible experience, they simply turn it this way and that till they find a new aspect to emphasize. One that makes them feel better about themselves. Don’t believe me? Go read any great person’s biography. It’s almost a given that winners only become winners after overcoming huge difficulties. And they overcome because they keep trying, keep learning how to control their own thinking until they get good at it.\n\nSo if you’ve got anything — ANYTHING AT ALL — in your past that drags you down, angers you or depresses you, you have the right to look at it more closely. You can find more than garbage in your past. There’s gold in your history, too. And all you’ve got to do is learn to look for it."},{title:"Motivation The Defining Moment Of Self Improvement",body:"For any aspect of self-improvement, there has to be a reason for you to start and keep going. That is your motivation – the reason for doing what you do. In order to attempt any sort of improvement in your life, you need to be motivated in some way to get started. Strategies for self-improvement start with defining what it is you want to achieve and then charting a course through which you can effect the improvements or changes. These do not have to be drastic changes – they could be something as simple as making time for yourself to write in a journal each day or something to improve your health, such as quitting smoking.\n\nMotivation comes from within. It is something that you want to do for you. This is what keeps you going, getting up each day and going off to work. Children are often the motivating force behind parents saving money, when they would ordinarily blow it on something frivolous. You know that you will need money for your children’s higher education or to give them the extras that they want, such as toys and brand name clothing. This is the reason that you work each day, maintain a home and spend time enjoying each other.\n\nIf you don’t have something to look forward to or see some sense of gratification in what you do, then there is no motivation to get doing it. Just meeting with colleagues helps you get a sense of who you are and your place in the world. Socialization, confidence and improvement are three main aspects of life. When you enjoy life, you can be motivated to achieve great things. Achievement does not have to be something that everyone recognizes. It can be something as simple as learning to make a quilt or to use a saw to create beautiful woodwork. The end result is the feeling of accomplishment that you have in yourself."},{title:"Break Through Self Doubt And Fear",body:"Self-doubt and fear interfere with our ability to achieve or set goals. Self-doubt and fear are the voices in our head telling us, “You’ll never succeed, so why try?” and “who do you think you are?” Self-doubt and fear are also what make us listen to those voices and decide to give up before we get started.  While many people experience self-doubt and fear at some point in their lives, they take action anyway. Others remain stuck, or are confident in only one area of their life, such as work. They are too afraid to try new things like going back to school, entering new relationships or learning new skills.  When we let self-doubt and fear rule our lives, we miss opportunities. We predict and believe that nothing good will happen to us, so we don’t try anything new, and refuse to take even low-level risks. This leads us to discount people or situations that could help us reach our goals. While self doubt and fear can come in different forms and from different sources, we can learn to break through them.  the vicious cycle of self-doubt and fear\n\nI know what it’s like to live with self-doubt and fear. For years my life was ruled by these feelings. I grew up in a lower income family in the Bronx, New York. I heard over and over again that people like us could never really be successful.  As early as kindergarten my teacher told my mother I was slow and not to expect too much from me. I was put in the slow-learners class. In reality, I was very smart but bored. My next teacher recognized this and moved me from the slow-learners class to the the advanced class. But I still had my voices telling me: “You’ll never make it. You’ll never be popular”. I felt I wasn’t as good as other people because I didn’t have the money and nice clothes that some of the other girls had. I was also shy and not in the popular crowd. I internalized outside messages and became a troublemaker.  My parents viewed my education as a pathway for becoming a teacher, social worker or civil servant. They limited my vision and left me believing that I didn’t have a choice in what I wanted for my future. I couldn’t understand how people became successful at something. But others saw potential in me. I was encouraged to study journalism and was placed in a special writing program. It could have been an incredible opportunity. Instead, I listened to my fears that I’d never make it, so I left the program and pretended that I didn’t care.  Later, I got accepted to the High School of Performing Arts in New York. Acting had always been my dream, despite the fact that people said my “blue collar” Bronx accent would keep me from success. My parents loved me but didn’t know how to give me support. They told me it was good to go to Performing Arts but that being an actor was out of reach for me. Rather than focus on the fact that I had gotten accepted to this wonderful school, I focused on the negative. My perception was that everyone else was wealthier, more experienced and more talented than me. I told myself: “You’re not as good as everyone else. If you try and don’t make it, you’ll look like a fool. But if you don’t try, you can still be cool.” I pretended that I didn’t really want to act. I didn’t try, and I sabotaged myself. I felt like I had no one to talk to about my ambition. Eventually, I gave up trying and left. I told everyone, including myself, that it didn’t matter. But the truth is, I had been afraid to try.  I spent the next two years in another high school, where I used drugs daily and became an addict. I still managed to do well on tests and graduated from high school at age 16. None of that meant anything to me, because by that time I had such low self-esteem, I thought if I could do it, it must be easy. I continued to feel that I was never good enough. My life was defined by what other people thought of me.  I had other opportunities. I was approached on the street by a magazine photographer and became a model at one of the top agencies in the world. I still carried my negative messages and told myself I couldn’t do it. I still felt that I was unattractive and couldn’t conceive of success. I gave up and dropped out. I just didn’t believe in my ability to accomplish anything.  I tried moving to Eugene, Oregon because I blamed my problems on where I lived and the people in my life. In one year I managed to gain over 90 pounds and get addicted to coffee, cigarettes and other substances. I blamed everyone else for my lack of money, healthy relationships and happiness. I lived in constant fear but was afraid to admit it.  My self-destruction finally resulted in a breakdown of my physical health and I had to be hospitalized and undergo major surgery. Doctors told me what I already knew: I had to make a major change. It was time to look at my past and my present and to decide what I wanted for my future. If I didn’t break through negative thoughts I would always stay where I was.  making positive changes\n\nI had to learn to change my attitude about myself. I read about and talked to people who had broken through their self-doubts and taken control of their lives. I got support from others and consciously began turning my destructive self-talk into constructive self-talk. I knew that if I took certain actions, my mind and emotions would follow. I let go of people who negatively influenced my life. I told myself that I was important, and began to plan and achieve my goals. I learned to have faith in my ability. I quit smoking, gave up coffee, and began exercising and eating well. The people I spent time with were also making positive changes in their lives. My life began to improve. I no longer saw myself as a victim. I learned to let go of blame and started taking small risks. I stopped comparing myself to other people and began to open up to new opportunities.  Today I have a successful speaking and consulting business. I have close friends, and a wonderful son. Learning from my life and others, I’m raising him to believe in himself, understand his feelings, and not be afraid of his fears. I travel throughout the country talking to corporations, associations and other organizations.  If you need help overcoming feelings of self-doubt and fear, please read these ten techniques and processes that have helped me get to this place in my life. \n\n1. Make a list of your fears. Only by admitting that they exist can you seek solutions. 2. Write down how these fears affect your life. 3. Become aware of the voices in your head and write down those negative messages. 4. Start building a support system of friends and eliminate people from your life who foster feelings of negativity. 5. Join a support group of people who have similar issues. 6. Change each negative message to one that is affirming and constructive. 7. Read books that help you feel better about yourself. 8. Be aware of your past, and be willing to let go of it. 9. List your goals and the actions you need to achieve them. 10. Take one of those actions every day. Each time you do something that brings you closer to achieving your goals you will feel better about yourself. \n\nWhen fears and self-doubts come back, and they still do, I break through them by using the tools and skills I’ve learned and now teach. They work."},{title:"Music For Self Improvement",body:"Would you like to pop in a CD and have a better quality of life, and even self improvement? There are three ways you can use music to accomplish this.\n\nMusic For Motivation\n\nPut on energetic music, and even doing housework seems less like work. Using music to motivate yourself or change your mood is an area where you can trust your experience and experimentation. When you find the music that energizes you, relaxes you, or makes you happy, keep it ready for when you need it.\n\nMusic For Intelligence\n\nMusic creates neural pathways in your brain that stimulate creativity. Studies show that music trains the brain for higher forms of thinking. In one study, three-year-olds were split into two groups. The first had no special training in, or exposure to music. The second group studied piano and sang daily in chorus. Eight months later the musical three-year-olds were much better at solving puzzles. They also scored 80% higher in spatial intelligence than the other group. There’s also anectdotal evidence that listening to music, especially from Mozart’s era, can help you study and learn better. Hopefully there will be more research. In the meantime there’s no reason not to do your own experimentation. I’ve heard that Stephen King writes with loud rock music playing, so the benefits of music may be according to your own tastes or brain-organization.\n\nMusic For Brainwave Entrainment\n\nWant to listen to some music, and get smarter, or have instant easy meditation? There are products now that “entrain” your brainwaves, in order to put you in a meditative state. Music is embedded with beats and pulses that entrain your brain waves to a specific frequency. Put in the right CD or MP3 for your activity, and you get better brain function. Science? Partly.\n\nBrain wave frequencies vary with mental state. Daydreaming and light meditation take place in the “Alpha” range of frequencies, for example. So if you listen to music containing beats at a frequency of 10 Hz you will generate more brainwaves at a 10 Hz frequency and enter a relaxed Alpha mental state. Do these things really work?\n\nYes. I’ve found two products that put me in a peaceful state unlike any other music or meditative practice. Studies will prove the effects (some have already), and disprove the wilder claims. Given my results, however, I wouldn’t wait for more research. Many things work long before the scientific proof arrives.\n\nIf you are skeptical, you can wait for more evidence of the benefits of brainwave entrainment. Meanwhile, why not try classical music when you study, just to see if it helps? Experiment with music – Mozart isn’t dangerous."},{title:"Increasing Prosperity With Positive Thinking",body:"Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful. They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”\n\nIf we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?\n\nWe must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.\n\nFollowing are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity into your life:\n\nBe grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.\n\nUse positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.\n\nCreative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and you will become so.\n\nEncourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.\n\nStart a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.\n\nFinally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?\n\nRemember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!"},{title:"Learn How To Motivate Yourself",body:"“Motivation will almost always beat mere talent.”\n\n~ Norman Augustine\n\nI truly believe Augustine’s words are true and if you look at history you know it is true. There are many people in the world with amazing talents who realize only a small percentage of their potential. We all know people who live this truth.\n\nWe also know those epic stories, those modern-day legends surrounding the early failures of such supremely successful folks as Michael Jordan and Bill Gates. We can look a bit further back in time to Albert Einstein or even further back to Abraham Lincoln. What made each of these people so successful? Motivation.\n\nWe know this in our gut, but what can we do about it? How can we motivate ourselves? One of the most difficult aspects of achieving success is staying motivated over the long haul.\n\nMotivation is not an accident or something that someone else can give you — you are the only one with the power to motivate you. Motivation cannot be an external force, it must come from within as the natural product of your desire to achieve something and your belief that you are capable to succeed at your goal.\n\nPositive pleasure-oriented goals are much more powerful motivators than negative fear-based ones. Although each is successful separately, the right combination of both is the most powerful motivational force known to humankind.\n\nHere are some tips and methods for motivating yourself:\n\n~ Use a past defeat as a motivator. Remind yourself you have nowhere to go except up as you have already been at the bottom.\n\n~ Give yourself the power of responsibility. Remind yourself the only thing stopping you is yourself.\n\n~ Make a list of your achievements toward your long-term goal and remind yourself that intentions don’t count, only action’s.\n\n~ Do it today. Remind yourself of someone you know who died suddenly and the fact that there is no guarantee that tomorrow will come.\n\n~ Let success motivate you. Find a picture of what epitomizes success to you and then pull it out when you are in need of motivation.\n\nReflect and experiment until you find the right combination of motivators for your personality and your personal goals. I’ll leave you with this final motivating quote:\n\n“What drives me? The thing that drives me most is the desire to find my limits–and extend them.” ~ Richard Marcinko\n\nNow go push your own limits and succeed!"},{title:"How Do I Know If I M Getting Any Of This Law Of Attraction Stuff",body:"This is a popular question people ask me. How do you know if I am mastering the art of Deliberate Attraction? Is there an advanced course I can take? My answer is always the same, “The application of this material into your daily life IS the advanced course!” To help you gauge where you’re at in the mastery of Law of Attraction, I’ve compiled a list of seven sure-fire ways to tell if YOU are joining the thousands of people who really are mastering this stuff.\n\n7 TOP indicators that I am mastering Law of Attraction\n\n1. I understand and accept that Law of Attraction is a process. It is a process of gradually reducing the negative vibrational patterns I have towards some areas in my life and replacing them with positive thoughts. Through the intentional and deliberate use of the tools of Law of Attraction, I see evidence that my allowing is gradually increasing.\n\n2. Over time I am seeing some behavioural changes in myself. Even though I constantly hear others using don’t, not and no I have eventually stopped using these words out loud. Each time I catch myself even thinking these words, I automatically ask myself the question, “So what DO I want?” I know that when I change my words, my vibration changes and I can only hold one vibration at a time.\n\n3. I’ve noticed over time that I am observing contrast (anything that doesn’t feel good to me) more and more briefly.\n\n4. I’ve noticed that I am having fewer and fewer experiences of negative people and events in my life. 5. It’s become second nature for me to be aware of many, many more things that I can appreciate and express gratitude for.\n\n6. I find myself automatically assigning all my new desires to Law of Attraction. When I want something new in my life I say, “I’m using Law of Attraction to get that!”\n\n7. I understand the expression I get what I vibrate and I hold myself fully accountable for everything that shows up in my life, both positive and negative!"
},{title:"Don T Let The Outtakes Take You Out",body:"One of my favourite things I like to watch is the bloopers and outtakes that are shown of mistakes made during the making of a movie. Most DVD’s have a section of outtakes to be viewed, and often they will set me off laughing, especially when you know what was supposed to happen. In one sense it seems strange to laugh at other people’s mistakes, and yet we all do it, and our enjoyment is not usually of malicious intent. We laugh because we can all relate and identify how much part of being human such bloopers are!\n\nWe all make mistakes, and have many bloopers and outtakes in a lifetime. Some of them may be funny like movie bloopers, a stupid mistake and we are able to laugh at our selves. Other outtakes in life, however, are not funny, and are neither unforeseen nor self imposed. I am referring to the tragic turns of events that happen in life that can turn our life and routine around in a moment. Accidents, disaster, the death of a loved one happen unexpectedly, and can profoundly affect our lives. These are outtakes we would prefer not to happen or even replayed in life. Some of life’s outtakes have the potential to embarrass, humiliate, hurt, or disappoint us and also can stop our hopes and dreams for ever. Times of crisis and tragedy can not be prevented, but how you handle these outtakes will affect the rest of your life. There is always a choice in any crisis. We can choose to grieve, but cling on to hope and move forward, or choose to cling onto the past and become stuck there. We cannot choose our circumstances, but we do have a choice how we respond to them. We can succumb or overcome, and our choice will determine our future. When we drive a car our focus is the road ahead; if we spend all our time looking in the rearview mirror failure is more or less inevitable! The same is true in life, we will fail, or at best remain at a standstill if we keep looking back and focusing on the events behind us, reliving the past.\n\nA young African-American girl was born to unwed impoverished teenagers, in the racially charged backwoods of Mississippi in the middle of the twentieth century. She was abused by male relatives, and became pregnant at age fourteen. This girl did not seem to have many choices about her future and its potential to turn around towards success. However, this girl determined that these devastating outtakes of her life would not predetermine her future. Despite her circumstances this girl learned how to succeed by working hard, being true to herself and communicating with compassion and honesty.\n\nThis woman’s success story may seem like a fairy tale, for Oprah Winfrey is now one of the most well known and influential women in the world. However Oprah would acknowledge that her tragic childhood experiences have helped her remain true to her commitment to persevere and aim for excellence. Oprah Winfrey is well known for her TV show, O magazine and book club, but also for the way she had explicitly described her own battles with depression, her weight and her relationships. She has made many connections between her past struggles and poor choices to the ‘aha’ moments that motivated her to take those experiences and learn from them, ultimately bringing her to a place more success and respect. Oprah chose to overcome, not to succumb.\n\nOprah is one of numerous examples of people who overcame the outtakes of their life and did not allow the odds to intimidate them. Just as actors learn from their mistakes and use them to improve their performance, so can we use our outtakes to improve our lives.\n\nDon’t let your outtakes ‘take you out'; use them to take you forward."},{title:"How I Lost The Secret Of Dazzling Success For 20 Years",body:"Ever heard of the Fuller Brush Man? You know, those legendary guys who came knocking on the front doors of America, selling brushes, mops and cleaners?\n\nI was one of them, back in my early twenties.\n\nI had just quit a job in an employment agency after four-and-a-half very long, very stressful days.\n\nConfined for eight hours a day to an incredibly tiny cubicle, ear pressed to the phone calling through the yellow pages trying to find job listings, then on my very first interview having to lie to a girl about a fictitious job the boss had advertised to pull in applicants. (Can you say bait-and-switch?)\n\nThat girl knew I was lying, and when she walked out the door, I walked out, too, almost on her heels.\n\nSo when I started a new job selling door-to-door, it seemed like heaven in comparison. No cubical – I was outdoors in the June sunshine and balmy breezes. No telephone – I was talking to people face to face.\n\nAnd no lying. If I didn’t think a product measured up, I simply didn’t put it in my case; I only showed what I thought was the best.\n\nI was ecstatic from the first minute of the first day.\n\nEvery house I walked up to, my heart sang and I said over and over to myself, “I am SO-O-O-O-O-O glad to be out here and not trapped in that cubical.”\n\nI was deliriously happy to be where I was. Overjoyed to be doing what I was doing.\n\nAnd sell? Man, I sold just about half of all the people I talked to. Back in the early sixties, a hundred-dollar-day was the holy grail of Fuller Brush men. Sales people would stay out till eight or nine o’clock every night trying to nail that hundred dollar mark.\n\nBut not me. I knocked off every afternoon about five or five-thirty with $120 or $130 worth of receipts in my order book.\n\nThen, after a few weeks, something quietly changed. My sales began to sag. Each morning saw me going out a little less enthusiastic. I spent increasing amounts of time trying to figure out what was going wrong.\n\nAfter a few months, I left that job, utterly disappointed in myself.\n\nAfterwards I wondered how I could have taken something so obviously perfect for me and messed it up so badly.\n\nIn fact, that question followed me, haunted me for twenty long years. Eventually, though, I figured it out.\n\nThe secret had been right in front of my nose all those years, but just as a fish can’t see the water it swims in, I had been unable to repeat that undeniable success.\n\nMy big secret? It was simple, really.\n\nI had filled my mind with thankfulness – undiluted gratitude – unreserved joy at being right where I was, doing exactly what I was doing.\n\nThen, twenty years later, when I started being thankful again – but deliberately, this time – my life changed back.\n\nSuddenly, all sorts of “serendipitous” things started occurring. People I barely knew started bringing me terrific opportunities.\n\nMark this: Joyous stuff started happening AFTER I went back to being overjoyed with my life.\n\nMake no mistake – there were still challenges that needed to be dealt with. But I stopped seeing “problems” as personal affronts deliberately sent by life to impede me. In fact, with the right mindset, I couldn’t see problems at all. Instead, they looked like fascinating puzzles to solve and games to enjoy sorting out.\n\nAnd even now, anytime I feel life becoming a bit too stressful, a bit too heavy, a bit less fun, I make myself stop and – against all logic – I start looking at all the stuff around me and calling it good.\n\nAnd yes, I even make myself say, “I am SO-O-O-O-O glad to be right here, right now.” And I don’t stop saying that until I can feel it taking hold.\n\nNow, I realize that on the surface, there is absolutely no logic to this practice… except for one tiny thing.\n\nIt works.\n\nSo if you decide to try this approach, do this: make a list of all your major problems and start through them, one at a time, saying, “I am so glad this is happening. This is actually very interesting now that I look at it closely, and I’m lucky to be here so I can gain some great new knowledge from this. I am SO-O-O-O-O glad.”\n\nWarning: you’ve got to put some real oomph into it. Some real feeling. Just saying the words without working up some enthusiasm is like writing a letter without a pen in your hand. You’re going through all the motions, but no communication takes place.\n\nSo do that, and keep doing it till it starts taking hold.\n\nHow can you tell when it’s taking hold?\n\nThere are two signs. First, you begin to lose that tense, blocked, frustrated feeling. And second, your life starts working FOR you instead of AGAINST you. Lots of little things start going right instead of wrong. People begin treating you like you’ve always wanted them to.\n\nAnd you go to bed each night feeling like you’ve just had a wonderful day.\n\nIf you’ve tried and tried all the logical stuff and your life is still a mess, try being illogical. Try being thankful for everything you’ve got. And you’ll find, just as I have, that indeed there is a miracle in every mess."},{title:"Impact Of Extrinsic Motivation On Intrinsic Motivation",body:"Motivation can be simply defined as the things that induce us to take certain actions or behave in a certain way. It is the why or the reason that drives a person towards a desired goal.\n\nThe reasons can be categorized into something that is within us i.e. intrinsic / internal motivation, or something that is external to us i.e. extrinsic / external motivation.\n\nInternal motivation in performing a task occurs when the task in itself is experienced as rewarding and there is no need for any external reward before it is performed. Examples are love of the task, self-satisfaction, sense of achievement, relaxation purpose, etc.\n\nExternal motivation in performing a task occurs when the task is performed because of an external reward. Examples are praise, recognition, money, stickers, grades, material rewards, etc.\n\nMotivation can be seen as a continuum from being externally driven to becoming more internally driven. All of us start off in life being externally driven. Remember how many children are bribed with sweets or stickers, and do things to get praise from adults. But as we mature and our material needs become more satisfied, we become more internally driven. Though intrinsic motivation is generally accepted as being better as it is within the internal control of the person, external motivation is useful in helping a person initially to get on a task when he does not feel intrinsically motivated to do so.\n\nHowever, the excessive use of external motivation might have detrimental effects. This has been shown in research or experiments that examine the effects of external reward on an internally motivated task.\n\nThe 1973 paper “Undermining children’s intrinsic interest with extrinsic rewards: A test of the overjustification hypothesis” by M Lepper, D Green & R Nisbett, reported an interesting experimental observation. During children’s free-play time, a fun drawing activity was introduced. They observed the children playing and selected those children who appeared to find intrinsic satisfaction in drawing. These children were placed under three different conditions. Condition 1: “Good Player” certificate was shown to some of the children, and asked if they would like to draw to win the certificate. Condition 2: Some children were given the opportunity to simply engage in drawing and the children were given the “Good Player” certificate unexpectedly. Condition 3: Some children simply drew without expecting or receiving any reward.\n\nTwo weeks later, all these children were again allowed to engage in the drawing activity. The result was interesting. It was found that the children who chose to draw for the reward showed less interest in drawing, and also when the reward was withdrawn, these children simply stopped drawing. Children in the other two conditions showed no significant change in their interest in drawing. The result seems to suggest that the external reward of a “Good Player” certificate destroyed the original intrinsic motivation for drawing.\n\nIn 1975, EL Deci reported his research findings in the paper “Intrinsic motivation”, that when people were given rewards for pursuing intrinsically satisfying goals, decreased motivation was the result. The result seems to suggest that if people already enjoy what they are doing, giving rewards for their engaging in this activity can act as a deterrent in continuing with that activity.\n\nThese two reports seem to suggest that external rewards can destroy intrinsic motivation. There is therefore the danger of “overjustification” in our enthusiasm to motivate good performance through rewards.\n\nWhat are the lessons that we can learn in motivating our children, students or subordinates? Suggestions are:\n\n1. Develop intrinsic motivation for tasks, e.g. by providing a safe environment for them to pursue their own interests without undue interference.\n\n2. Encourage intrinsic motivation for tasks e.g. providing opportunities for sharing of work and of the personal satisfaction gained.\n\n3. Provide external rewards sparingly, and without giving expectations for it.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. http://www.succezz.com/S2/ForbiddenPsychologicalTactics.html"},{title:"Sometimes Typhoons Come",body:"Tonight half of southern Japan is hunched down awaiting the arrival of the typhoon. This is #15 for the Pacific region this year, and the third one in about six weeks to come our way. By the way, if you’re not quite sure what a typhoon is, it’s the Asian name for tropical storms or hurricanes. Our little town of about 18,000 has only one industry — its white beach — and it waits all year for the two hottest summer months when hundreds of thousands of vacationers come from all over Japan to lie in the sun and play in the peaceful little bay. And this particular night, the town had planned its annual fireworks display. They have something called “Message Fireworks” where a visitor pays up to a hundred dollars for somebody to read an announcement of his undying love just before a volley of fireworks are fired off. This one event raises many thousands of dollars for the town. In addition, the local merchants make a sizeable part of their yearly profit during the summer months. But tonight the beach is dark. No fireworks will dazzle the crowds tonight. No concession booths will sell snacks, and no families will congregate to enjoy the summertime display.\n\nAll those plans. All the money invested in food, in merchandise, in giant fireworks that shoot two hundred meters into the air. So when a typhoon comes — and no amount of “positive thinking” will stop it happening from time to time — the merchants here just sigh, suck it up, and go to Plan B, which is to try again tomorrow night. And if that doesn’t work, then next weekend. You see, they’ve seen it all before. They know that sometimes things WILL get in the way of their plans. So they stay flexible. They have contingencies, Plan B’s and even Plan C’s. Now, the point I’m making is not that weather is a doggone nuisance. Instead, I invite you to consider one question: how flexible are you prepared to be? (The operative word is “prepared”.) When stuff happens — and it will — what’s your Plan B and your Plan C? Don’t have one? Then shouldn’t you think about getting one? Because stuff WILL happen. That’s just the way life brings you special opportunities you never expected, never imagined, and never wanted. But once life brings it on, you need to be prepared to deal with it. Like a boy scout, you need to be prepared with backup plans.\n\nBut to have a backup plan, you first need a main plan.

Dreams have tremendous power. They sustain us through desperate times and drive us through difficult ones and give us hope for the future. More important-they inspire us!\n\nWhere would human beings be without dreams? Would we have explored distant places or invented the means to travel to those destinations? How many children are alive today thanks to the dreams of doctors and scientists? What works of art lift the hearts of countless masses due to the dreams of artists?\n\nIn the end so much is possible thanks to the power of dreams and yet so many people seem unwilling to free their own dreams. They shrug them off, ignore them, or reject them entirely-too difficult, impossible, ridiculous, meaningless.\n\nBut even the most frivolous dreams have meaning. If one person’s life is touched by that dream-whether they are inspired, changed, or simply lightened-then that dream has power and meaning.\n\nIt is sad that in our society to be called a “dreamer” is actually an insult. In many societies, to be a dreamer was once a high calling. If we think of all that dreams have caused-from space travel to the creation of the United States of America to a polio vaccine-perhaps we can make dreaming acceptable again.\n\nWhat do you do with your own dreams? Do you dare to voice them, dare to do something about them? Or do you instead spend your time finding excuses for why your dreams are impossible?\n\nNo dream is impossible! You have to believe that and you have to dare to dream, or your dream will be impossible, but there is no one to blame but yourself because you never let it become possible. Perhaps that is why so many perceive being a “dreamer” as something negative, because they view it as a passive exercise, but being a true “dreamer” is anything but passive-it requires action!\n\nYes, it is scary to dream, it is scary to take a leap of faith, to risk yourself. Even more frightening than failure is the knowledge that once you take that risk you will have lost your dream forever.\n\nBut do not be afraid, you can succeed, but even if THIS dream does fail, once you’ve become someone that dares to dream there will be others. Once you’ve made that change, once you’ve become a dreamer, there is no going back–and that is certainly a step on the road to success!\n\nSo, remember to Dare to Dream!"},{title:"Change Your Mind Change Your Luck",body:"When I was a young man, even a teenager for that matter, I always had an optimism that was hard for others to overcome.

I remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nIt didn’t matter how many times I was chased home. It didn’t matter how many times the girls bullied me. It didn’t matter how many times my father beat me. It didn’t matter how many times the teachers picked on me. I just knew; This is not it! There is more greatness to come!\n\nWhen I was kicked out and made to join the military, I wasn’t feeling particularly lucky at that time but I still had that positive attitude. Sure there was grief, and I knew, I just knew that there were still great things to come. I did my military service and got out and that pervasive optimism, while struggling for a while arose and pulled me into the most amazing journey within another set of circumstances that saw many wonderful things happen.\n\nAs I remember, my body begins to remember. There is an energy that lives inside the memory, it’s not just the mind. I am lucky. Life is good. Great things will happen. This is exciting. What next? Bring it on.

It’s simple really, but will require the patience to take each task into consideration, without doing everything at once.\n\nYou will get the urge to make up for lost time. You now want to jump ahead at “light speed.” If you already read Parts One and Two of this series, you are way ahead of the pack. So many people sit around and dream, doubt, or just talk, but very few take action and then stick with it.\n\nThe next step is to get a “coach.” You are now thinking, coaches are expensive; and you are right, but you don’t have to spend much. Here’s how it works: Look for the most positive person you can find, see, or hear, around you. This person is full of positive energy, and all you have to do is listen.\n\nYou can be selective about advice, but realize that positive energy is contagious, and you will walk away from conversations with positive energy, too. On the other hand, stay away from negative talk; it is also contagious.\n\nAre you in need of more positive energy? No problem – read articles like this, read self-improvement books, or listen to inspirational audio books, to instill positive energy within you. You can’t lose with a steady dose of positive energy to carry you through the day.\n\nSo how do you separate good information from bad? Where do you start, and what, or who, would you listen to first? In the last, and final article of this series, I promise to reveal some great resources, but for now, it’s a good idea to gain positive energy by choosing sources that you find interesting.\n\nIf I lead you to a classic self-improvement book, you might find it boring. However, if you start to read something and can’t put it down, you are getting positive energy and you are enjoying it.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and get a self-improvement source today. You don’t have to implement all of the advice you read – just take what fits into your lifestyle.\n\nNow, let’s look at visualization. This is an extremely powerful treasure, and all of us have the ability to visualize. Ever since the first human had a fantasy, and it came to pass, the power of visualization has built entire civilizations.\n\nThink about what you want, close your eyes, envision it, and see that you have accomplished it. This is only an exercise, but it is an exercise toward success.

No doubt you have certain expectations about your upcoming journey.\n\nPerhaps you’re the kind of person who expects to spend your days admiring amazing architecture and prowling world-famous museums for masterpieces. Or maybe you’re going to Europe to meet interesting people, relax on the beach until the sun goes down, and dance the night away in a local club. Regardless of your European vacation priorities, you certainly expect it to be wonderful!\n\nBut stop a moment. Have you thought about your cultural expectations? Many European vacationers plan their activities and accommodations with the assumption that everything else will be “like America.” If so, think again! Just as Europe and the US are different in landscape, weather, and history, they are also very different culturally. Europeans and Americans have different ideas about manners, time, personal space, personal property maintenance, and language.\n\nSo for anyone planning a vacation to Europe, here are a few “cross cultural conflict” areas that Americans traveling in Europe often encounter. Making yourself aware of these differences can help you have a fun, enjoyable, and even educational European vacation that is free of cultural misunderstandings!\n\nPersonal Space\n\nTake a glance at a map of the world. Which is smaller: the US or Europe? That’s right– Europe. But there are still a lot of people there, which means they’ve gotten used to smaller spaces!\n\nAmerican standards of living are very high. We’re used to king size beds and bathrooms that can accommodate several people at a time.\n\nBut unless you’re staying in a massive French chateau or Italian villa, be prepared for spaces to be smaller than you’re used to. Bedrooms and bathrooms will be more compact, as will bed sizes. Single and double beds alike will be narrower. Kitchens won’t be able to accommodate your entire family! So consider this an opportunity to get closer to your traveling companions. Think of sharing a bathroom in Italy as an exercise in cooperation. Get cozy with your spouse in that French double bed. Be willing to laugh as you adjust. Get creative and have fun!\n\nManners\n\nA common misperception of Europeans is that they are “rude.” Of course, they think the same thing about us! Remember when you’re traveling in Europe that rudeness is largely a cultural perception. Someone who seems blunt and nosey may be expressing friendship and concern for your well-being. A waiter who tells you what to order may be trying to help, since you are unfamiliar with the language. Differences in “personal space” mean that someone who cuts in front of you may not even understand that you were in line! Also, subjects which are taboo in your community may be freely discussed elsewhere, and vice versa. In the US, we consider it incredibly rude to comment on a person’s weight. This isn’t true everywhere in the world! So, when traveling in Europe, keep a firm grip on your temper. A good way to achieve this is to give everyone else the benefit of the doubt. Just make the choice not to get angry. If you can roll with the punches, you’ll enjoy your vacation more– and you’ll be a better traveling companion. Time\n\nI have to admit that I get impatient if I have to wait longer than fifteen minutes at a restaurant in the US. After the food comes, I can be out the door in half an hour! In Italy, however, a dinner filled with conversation, laughter, and great food can last two hours! I smile when I hear other Americans asking why the food hasn’t arrived yet. Unbeknownst to them, the waiters are offering them the opportunity to savor the meal. Likewise, shops and businesses in Spain close for an afternoon siesta. In the UK, the handyman may want to chat with you before repairing that pipe. Most Europeans do not share the American compulsion to “save time” by doing everything quickly. So when you vacation in Europe, leave your watch behind. After all, this is a vacation!\n\nQuality\n\nI often hear complaints, especially from those who rent a villa or apartment, about the quality of the furnishings and amenities in Europe. I’d be a millionaire if I had a dime for every time I heard someone say “The furniture was old!” or “The bathroom pipes need to be replaced.” In today’s society, we expect things to look like new, feel like new, and behave like new. If it doesn’t, we throw it away. But think of anyone who grew up during the depression. My grandfather kept rows of old coffee cans filled with spare nails and bits of wire. He sat in the same chair every night until he died. Nothing was wasted, and nothing was thrown away if it could be fixed. So if the furniture looks a little worn, or if the sink clogs, think before you complain. Is the quality due to neglect and disrepair, or is it the result of a careful, conscientious effort not to put anything to waste? Treat this as an educational experience; you might even learn from a more conservative lifestyle. Language\n\nAs an American, I am often jealous of Europeans who pick up languages like you’d pick up a bottle of milk at the store. For me, it’s an uphill battle all the way!\n\nSince learning three or four languages is neither a cultural necessity nor a scholastic requirement in our country, many Americans feel like me. And yet some Americans still assume that everyone in Europe should speak English! In the same way that you or I would resent a French tourist who expected everyone in the US to speak French, Europeans are often annoyed by Americans who have this mentality. While you probably can’t learn a new language before your vacation, you can learn some helpful phrases. This is considered courteous, and is guaranteed to get more friendly responses. When you try to use their language, Italians or French who might have feigned ignorance will usually help you with your pronunciation– and then converse with you in English! The Right Attitude\n\nLastly, remember that the standards and the customs you find while traveling in Europe are not wrong. They’re just different. If you travel with the right attitude, you will have a richer, more authentic, and even eye-opening experience. Who knows? Your European vacation may change the way you see the world."

Once the bill was passed and signed into law by the president, it became much harder to reverse the law. The democrats would need to bring up the law and get it to a vote, then after the vote passed it needs to go to the president for his signature. The problem with this is that the current president is the one who signed the bill into law in the first place.\n\nAnother problem is because the gambling ban was attached to another bill, it means that to reverse the law the entire bill needs to be reversed, but the other part of the bill is for an increase in port security, so any congressmen who recommends reversing this law, will be going on record as trying to reverse the increase in port security.\n\nBecause of this trying to get the law reversed could ruin a congressman’s chances of ever getting elected to public office again for the rest of their lives.\n\nIt is more likely that it will have to wait till the end of George Bushes term in office and then get an amendment to the law that reverses only gambling ban part of the law.\n\nSo if you are on Online Gambling enthusiast and you were hoping that after the election the online gambling ban would just disappear I am sorry to say you were mistaken and that you are going to have to wait a little longer, but that does not mean you need to sit quietly by.\n\nThe key is to make sure that you are heard, write letters to congressmen, and attend protest rallies anything that will keep this issue in the front of the minds of the politicians so they know that just as the Republicans lost the house so can they.\n\nThe republicans used the online gambling ban to try to gain votes for them in the last weeks before the election, but it backfired on them and lost them more votes then it brought in.\n\nHopefully the Democrats will learn from the mistakes of the Republicans and will understand that banning something never works, and that it is only thru regulating the online gambling industry that will ensure that it is safe and honest to play and that no underage children manage to play.\n\nOther wise I am sure that the Democrats will also see the wrath of the American voters when it comes time for the next elections.\n\nThe American people are tired of having the government controlling every aspect of their lives and I think this election may have made their point for them.\n\nSo if the question is will they try to reverse the law I am sure they will try, but how successful they will be is still up in the air, and no one can really know what the outcome will be."},{title:"Top Things To See During A Holiday In Hong Kong",body:"In my capacity as the UK Director of Operations for One World Tours Limited, one of my jobs is to ensure every client has the best tour possible, so here are my top suggestions for sites to take in during your holiday Hong Kong.\n\n1. I would recommend that a ride on the Star Ferry across the harbour is something to definitely experience. It is wonderful to see the people who have made a life on the harbour fishing and existing in the middle of the city. There is also an incredible floating restaurant on the harbour where you can experience wonderful culinary delights. 2. Taking the tram to the top of Victoria Peak is also something to experience if you have made the effort to go all the way to Hong Kong.\n\nThe pollution is something to experience in itself and going to the peak would best be done before it gets too bad if you wish to see the sights. Often though even if the view is bad, there are a couple of lads who will take your picture and superimpose it on a picture of what you would have seen on a clear day – quite fun !\n\n3. Ocean Park is a full-blown amusement park. There is a popular Dragon Roller Coaster, Ferris wheel and other white knuckle rides. There is a marine park with a Shark Aquarium that will interest the younger visitors to Hong Kong.\n\nYou will also see a traditional Chinese style village where street fairs add exciting colour to the whole atmosphere.\n\n4. Wong Tai Sin is the most well-known and temple in the city and is also the busiest. The temple is a stunning example of a traditional Chinese temple. What stood out to me when I visited was the temple was the clouds of smoke and the intense smell from the incense sticks that the visitors were burning. The Chinese believe that by burning these sticks that they will have good fortune. It is a free to visit the temple (donations are welcome).\n\n5. Yuen Po Street Bird Market. There are hundreds of exotic birds in equally exotic cages as buying a bird appears to be a business matter in Hong Kong. People spend hours with these birds and I was informed that customers will only buy a bird if the bird chooses them. It is considered to be bad luck to purchase a bird that is not happy as the birds happiness is of utmost importance to Hong Kongians. 6. If you are a shopaholic then a visit Stanley Market is a must. You will be able to pick up bargains for a fraction of the price the are sold for in town. This is a goo time to mention not to buy anything from a shop in the main city that does not have a name / board of the shop front. Shopkeepers in these shops may well take your money and tell you that they do not have the goods in stock. They then take your hotel details and promise to bring the items that you have paid for to your hotel and guess what? They don’t.\n\nRepulse Bay is the most famous beach in Hong Kong, apparently so named because the British army had seen off some pirates in olden times! This is a popular destination for the Chinese people and can become so packed that there is no room to sit! November is the best time to go if you want to avoid the rush and the temperature is still a comfortably warm 70 degrees."},{title:"Big Savings On Gas While You Travel",body:"Gas prices are soaring! This has resulted in elevated travel expenses. If you travel by car, YOU have some control over the costs.\n\nHere are some ways to save money on gas:\n\n* Switch to synthetic motor oil. It reduces engine friction and may make your car a little less ravenous at the gas station. (There are brands available claiming 5%-20% increases in fuel economy.)\n\n* Use the manufacturer’s recommended grade of oil. Manufacturer specs are based on what is best for your specific vehicle.\n\n* Buy gas with the recommended octane rating. Premium can actually be detrimental to many engines.\n\n* Fill up during the coolest times of day. You get more gas in each gallon, because liquids expand in the heat. The pumps are measuring gallons, not weight.\n\n* Make sure that the gas cap is tight after you fill up. Gas evaporates easily – you can lose an appreciable amount through an improperly seated cap.\n\n* Check your tires before your holiday and inflate them to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Underinflated tires create drag and increase gas consumption. Always carry a tire gauge in your glove compartment.\n\n* Never drive on bald tires! Besides being unsafe, they also increase fuel consumption.\n\n* Don’t leave your engine idling for long periods of time. This includes pre-warming – one minute is all you need. Start off slowly, then use normal speeds after a couple of minutes.\n\n* Don’t continually start and stop your engine. Each start burns about the same amount of gas as one minute of idle time.\n\n* Drive the speed limit on highways – speeding devours gas. Activate your cruise control whenever possible, and when cruise is not engaged remember the ‘egg’ trick: drive like you have a raw egg between the floorboards and the gas pedal.\n\n* Stop lights in cities are usually set to synchronize with the posted speed limit. Drive the speed limit and you are more likely to hit a long series of green lights. Stopping at red lights increases idle time and gas consumption.\n\n* Drive in a way that entails minimal use of the brakes.\n\n* Don’t pack more than you need. The more weight you carry, the more gas you use.\n\n* Decrease wind resistance. A car caked with mud, snow, or ice will cause drag and burn more gas than a sleek, clean vehicle.\n\n* Don’t use the air conditioner unless necessary. Vehicle air conditioners increase fuel consumption.\n\n* Pamper your vehicle by ensuring that it goes in for regular tune-ups and maintenance. Slight adjustments can mean dramatic fuel savings. Ask the maintenance people to add fuel injector cleaner whenever the oil is changed.\n\n* Some communities have websites that post fuel prices at local gas stations. Do your research before you leave to find out where the cheapest stations are. Use common sense: driving too far out of your way will gobble up more gas than you save. Try gasbuddy.com (USA and Canada) and your favorite search engines.\n\n* If you own a gas guzzler, try trading with a relative or neighbor for a smaller vehicle while you vacation. (Make sure that insurance policies on both vehicles are in order first.)\n\n* Use your feet! Once you get to your destination, walk whenever possible. Walking is how you really get to know an area.\n\nSave money, save the environment – and have more cash to spend on your vacation!"},{title:"Les Houches The Hidden Gem Of The Chamonix Valley",body:"In the heart of the French Alps, in the north east of the Rhone Alps region lies the village of Les Houches. Nestled at one end of the Chamonix valley in the Mont Blanc region of the Haute Savoie Les Houches had long been the considered a mere satellite village of its much more illustrious neighbour Chamonix – the world capital of skiing and mountaineering. Of course the locals knew better and many high mountain guides, ski instructors and pisteurs had long since migrated to this quite and peaceful corner of the Chamonix valley – drawn as much, perhaps, by it’s magnificent setting at the foot of Mont Blanc, it’s peace, tranquillity and traditional ambience as its more affordable property. However, it wasn’t long before the resort became recognised as a little gem in the centre of the Mont Blanc Massif and tourism bloomed due in a large part to Les Houches’ incredibly easy access to and from Geneva airport. It wasn’t always so. It was only with the construction of the new road between Le Fayet and Chamonix during 1860-70, and then with the arrival of the train in 1901, that Les Houches began to open up to summer tourism. It was then that Les Houches became a small holiday retreat and the first hotels and holiday homes began to appear. Les Houches first started as a winter destination with the construction of the Bellevue cable car in 1936-7. From the 1960s the growing tourism development led to the construction of new lift systems. But, it was with the digging of the Mont Blanc tunnel (1959-65) and the completion of the Route Blanche motorway in 1990 which opened up the village of Les Houches to the rest of Europe.\n\nSituated at a height of 1000 metres Les Houches is a pleasant family resort with an exceptional panorama of the Chamonix Aiguilles which encircle the Chamonix valley. The village is made up of a number of small hamlets, with numerous old farms and chapels and enjoys fantastic 360      "},{title:"Cheap Romantic Vacations",body:"It is not always possible to jet off half way around the world when you and your significant other are wishing to go off on a private and romantic getaway.

For two out of every three people, this is the ultimate travel experience, according to recent research. Needless to say, in a world obsessed by travel, travelers and travel agents are both looking for the cheapest tickets and airfares available.\n\nCheap airline tickets, in most cases, can be obtained from wholesale dealers and discounters.\n\nIf your requirements are simple – you want a round-trip ticket from one place to another, you have a particular airline on your mind and you have definite dates; then you can go directly to the source – to the ticket discount agency which buys cheap tickets in bulk from wholesalers and consolidators.\n\nIn real life most trips require more planning, and most people need a help from the agent to figure out what would be the best air ticket solution for their particular case. Cheap airfares to a particular region can often be found with local airlines that specialize in that country. Sometimes an agency that operates and retails tours to a particular country will have a discount agreement with the national carrier and will sell discount tickets on that airline.\n\nWith a bit of research through travel magazines aimed at the particular country of your choice, you can often find agencies dealing with national carriers for that country. For the cheapest possible airfare to many places the most affordable prices are often found in local travel agencies that deal with a particular destination selling round-trip discount airline flights – most likely to the capital of that country and a few main cities.\n\nSometimes you can find a really cheap air ticket with a discount retail agency that specializes in trips to a wider range of destinations or to multiple destinations. Through the sheer number of tickets that they sell they can command a reasonable discount. However, keep in mind that most advertised prices do not include taxes, luggage fee and airport tax, so the cheap airfare may end up being not so cheap. Best to read the small print to clarify exactly what you are getting before you purchase a ticket.\n\nAnother trick of the trade is for agencies to grab attention by indicating the lowest possible prices, which only apply on specific dates in low season. You’ll find that all agencies do this, even the most expensive ones so, don’t be surprised if you get a quote at double the price from what was displayed in the ad.\n\nAirlines usually publish their scheduled flights and prices six months in advance. If you have decided on a destination it can be a good opportunity to get an ‘early bird’ discount by booking well in advance. Keep your eye on the travel press and also airline web-sites. There are often special discounts and incentives aimed at travelers who book online, as carrying out a booking online is cheaper for the company than through an intermediary who will take a commission.\n\nHowever, although you can expect to get the cheapest air ticket if you start searching many months ahead, there are some exceptions. At times like Christmas or other periods of high demand the prices are usually inflated and planes fill up many months in advance. If you can be flexible and travel on actual holiday days such as Christmas day or New Years Eve you can find some pretty attractive discounts."},{title:"Cost Cutting Ideas For Your Wedding",body:"Don’t leave your shopping to the last minute.

If you have never been on a helicopter before, this is a great place to do it. You will see all the beauty that Maui has to offer and can have a great time for the entire family. Tours are not too expensive and last from forty five minutes to over an hour. You can see places that are typically inaccessible with Maui helicopter tours. Places that are not available by foot or vehicle can be seen by air. Breathtaking sights await those who are up for some fun Maui helicopter tours. If you will be staying on the island for a considerable amount of time, you may want to think about doing multiple Maui helicopter tours. There are multiple destinations and you can see all the island has to offer.\n\nEast Maui helicopter tours will give you a view of the ten thousand foot volcano, Haleakala or House of the sun. This volcano is dormant and last erupted in 1790. You will be able to see the crater of the volcano and the dry, arid earth surrounding the south side of the volcano’s slop with Maui helicopter tours. The view of this is truly breathtaking and is a sight not to be missed. It is also highly educational with a chance to see a dormant volcano up close, something that can not be seen every day. On the northern and southern sides of the volcano, you will see an incredible different view however. These sides are lush and green and you will be able to see some beautiful waterfalls and gorgeous brush. Tropical rainforests abound on this side of the island and it is something that is not easily accessible by any other means than by air. Maui helicopter tours will allow you to see all of these sights. Make sure to take a camera or video with you when going on Maui helicopter tours to capture the beauty of the scenery and to show friends and family at home all the wonderful things you saw while on vacation.\n\nWest Maui helicopter tours have a slightly different view than what you will see in the east. The smaller of the two volcanoes on the island is on this side. Unlike the east volcano, this one is no dormant but extinct with millions of years of erosion cutting deep valleys and into the mountains. The rainfall is high in this are and it results in many waterfalls that cascade over the steep ridges. This area is entirely uninhabited and pure. There is no way to reach this destination except by air so if you want to see this breathtaking view, Maui helicopter tours are the way to go. It is said that this area of Maui is one of the most beautiful natural landscapes in the world and should be missed if you have the opportunity to take Maui helicopter tours to this part of the island. Since it is only accessible by air, this is the only way you will be able to see it.\n\nMolokai Maui helicopter tours will take you to a different island but one that is only nine miles away and easily accessible by air. This island has a very small population with a different culture and scenery. The entire coast of the northeast is lined with cliffs and remote beaches. They are completely inaccessible by any other means of transportation than air. People who live on the island have never even seen this remarkable scenery unless they have taken Maui helicopter tours to view it. When the weather has been rainy and there is a lot of rainfall for he season you will see many astounding waterfalls. The cliffs in this region are among the highest in the world and to see water cascading from the high peaks is simply breathtaking. The short jaunt from Maui with Maui helicopter tours is well worth seeing the beauty of this natural environment.\n\nMaui helicopter tours are a great way to tour those places that can not be reached on foot or by car. The tours last approximately one hour and range from approximately one hundred eight five dollars to two hundred forty dollars person. For many, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see natural scenery that will not be available again.

We make money and then invest our time and effort in making more money. Does it end? Not usually because we are never satisfied. How many times have we convinced ourselves that if only we had some more money, life would be so sweet? But then, after receiving a substantial raise, we realize that it wasn’t enough and that we need more?\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\nI have read many books on life such as Robin Sharma’s Monk says this and the monk says that, and they all seem to say that money is not necessary. But it is. Can you do without cash and a lot of it? I know I can’t. So, I went to the neighbourhood Rabbi and asked for advice that will help me find my true way in life. The rabbi nodded and took me to the window. “What do you see?” he asked me.\n\nPromptly, I answered, “I can see people walking to and fro and a blind man is begging for alms at the left corner.”\n\nThe Rabbi nodded and guided me to a big mirror. “Now look and tell me what you see?”\n\n“I can see myself,” I man answered.\n\nThe Rabbi smiled. “Now you can’t see anyone else. The mirror and the window are both created from the same raw material: glass, but because on one of them they have applied a thin layer of silver, when you look at it all you can see is your own reflection.”\n\nThe Rabbi placed his arm on my shoulders. “Compare yourself to those two pieces of glass. Without the silver layer, you saw the other people and felt compassion for them. When you are covered with silver, you see only yourself.”\n\nI looked at the Rabbi and stared. “I don’t understand.”\n\nThe Rabbi continued. “You will become someone only if have the courage to remove the silver covering over your eyes in order to again see and love others.” He patted me on my back and sent me on my way.\n\nI have thought of what he said and come to the conclusion that he had a point. Yes. We need money and we should not aim to lead a moneyless existence; its pointless and will only cause us and our families many heartbreaks in the future.\n\nInstead, I suggest that we should follow the advice the Rabbi gave me. When we approach life through a silver covering, all we are able to see is ourselves. But discard that covering, and you will be able to see and feel everyone else. \n\nIn life, we are allowed to and should be able to look at both kinds of mirrors, but we should remember that a mirror reflects only us; a window is the door to compassion, health and true wealth. In other words, seek wealth by all means, but don’t let it dissuade you from life, people, children and the poor and needy."},{title:"Overseas Adventure Travel In Nepal",body:"Thinking about overseas adventure travel?

Over a hundred Mexico resorts have reopened and the state tourism minister predicts Cancun will draw as many visitors in 2006 as it did two years ago. And the travel deals are great! If you haven’t been, now may be the best time to take a vacation to Cancun.\n\nSince Hurricane Wilma hit in late October, the clean up has been moving fast. In fact, commercial and charter flights are back on regular schedules and many of the Cancun hotels, restaurants, bars, shops, golf courses and clubs have reopened. Even the ancient Mayan sites of Tulum and Coba are open and looking better than ever. In an effort to repair the beaches, engineers have been working around the clock building the equivalent of two American football fields of beach a day by collecting the displaced sand, from 22 miles off shore, onto two ships and re-depositing it back in it’s original location.\n\nThe hotels and shops in Cancun continue to deliver exceptional, very personalized and attentive service. Clearly, Cancun wants everyone to come on back!\n\nAdditional Notes about the Restoration\n\nBeach Restoration Project Moving Forward: A $17 million beach restoration project, funded by the Mexican government, is currently underway. The project, which is expected to take about eight months to complete, will restore and augment beaches along the 7 1/2-mile stretch between Punta Cancun and Punta Nizuc.\n\nIt’s a Divers Paradise: Divers are enjoying less crowds, great conditions and personalized service now that those areas have re-opened.\n\nExpedia.com Helping Get the Word Out: Expedia is working closely with travel industry partners in Cancun to create more awareness about the region as well as setting up smart business practices for local merchants that will keep more money in the local communities.\n\nNew jobs: Cancun has added 10,000 new jobs since the Hurricane\n\nIts time to go to Cancun\n\nSo, when you make travel plans this year, don’t forget about Mexico’s number one vacation destination.

body:"When you’re looking for a romantic place to spend your honeymoon, wedding anniversary or just to have some time together, go for a boutique hotel.\n\nWhat small, chic, designer hotels don’t know about creating a romantic atmosphere isn’t worth knowing. Making guests feel welcome and unique is a hallmark of all these hotels, and if you call to ask for something special, they’ll make sure that you get it.\n\nWhy go all the way to Venice for a romantic weekend just to stay in a regular hotel?

But it is not their fault, because at their age they are naturally more inquisitive and more active. They are not content to stay put and lounge in the beach or hotel. They want lots of actions, something that your dream beach vacation cannot satisfy. Why not change your dream relaxation vacation to a fun family holiday? Virginia travel offers two exciting and affordable theme parks for your family’s enjoyment.\n\nThese theme parks are not prohibitively-priced, meaning you can still afford to stay at nice hotels. Hotels dot the Virginian landscape, and are especially near the theme parks. After all, there is no better way to end a fun afternoon than by sleeping in a cozy room. Although these theme parks are not like Disneyland which have its own hotel, the thrill rides and sights more than suffice for this shortcoming. Paramount’s Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens Williamsburg make Virginia travel something the whole family can enjoy.\n\nParamount’s Kings Dominion boasts of being a water and theme park in one. It is a 400-acre affair with over 200 attractions and rides. International roller coaster fanatics troop to Kings Dominion for its 13 famous and world-class coasters. Teenagers and daring adults alike enjoy the thrilling loops and drops of these coasters. The park features Hypersonic XLC, the only American coaster that uses compressed air for launch power. Volcano Blast Coaster shoots up over a volcanic crater before diving at over 70 mph. There are also wooden coasters like the Rebel Yell and Hurler. Virginia is famous for its cinema complexes, and its theme park are not complete without movies. There are two rides that are inspired by major motion pictures. Tomb Raider Firefall engages all the senses and makes riders feel that they are part of the big Lara Croft movie or video game. Italian Job Turbo Coaster mimics the stunt chase scenes from the popular movie. Speed through the garage and the tunnels in mini Coopers and relive the film’s thrilling chase. If the younger kids are not up to yelling themselves hoarse on the coasters, the Nickelodeon Central is alive with their favorite characters. Taking pictures and playing with Dora, the Rugrats, Spongebob, Scooby, and Jimmy Neutron are definitely allowed. There are also regular kiddie games wherein toddlers get to play and meet other children. For excitement, there is a spooky mansion and the Mystery Machine. All this fun for a fraction of a beach holiday. Plus, there are also season tickets and family promos.\n\nFor around-the-world fun, Busch Gardens Williamsburg is the place to go. The park is divided into six countries: Ireland, France, Scotland, Italy, Germany, and England. Each “country” showcases the best of their cultures with excellent food, landmarks, gardens, and parks. The authentic design and feel of the “countries” are enough to make visitors feel that they are country-hopping. The Busch Gardens is also home to a couple of the planet’s best 25 roller coasters: Alpengeist and Apollo’s Chariot. Virginia travel is not complete without some animal fun. Aside from the rides, the park is also big on environmental issues. It hosts a mini-zoo and animal sanctuary where the kids can see and interact with wolves, raptors, reptiles, and all things feathered, furry, and scaly. There are also lectures about environmental preservation. The park also offers discounts by availing of special cards and family promotions. Free entrance is also awarded to families of US service men.\n\nWith these two parks, Virginia travel is fun, easy, and very affordable. It also provides great bonding time for you and your family. Now, who says vacationing with kids is a hard chore?"},{title:"Travelagent India",body:"Namaskar, welcome to Incredible India, where culture echoes, tradition speaks, beauty enthralls and diversity delights.\n\nBounded by the majestic Himalayan ranges in the north and edged by an endless stretch of golden beaches, India is a vivid kaleidoscope of landscapes, magnificent historical sites and royal cities, misty mountain retreats, colorful people, rich cultures and festivities. The timeless mystery and beauty of India has been waiting for you for 5000 years, always warm and inviting, a place of infinite variety – one that favors you with different facets of its fascination every time you visit India.\n\nvisit the four corners of India: North India, South India, East India, West India\n\nNorth India – Land of Romance\n\nYou’ve arrived at Delhi. The months of planning and curiosity are over; you’re actually in India. Every experience, every sound, every smell shouts that you’ve arrived somewhere magical, somewhere Special. It is here that the deep love of one man for one woman created the Taj Mahal; where the King of Kings ruled; where the sacred Ganges flows past holy cities; where the Himalayas stand silent and magnificent; where 5000 years of culture waits to be absorbed.\n\nDelhi – the Old and the New\n\nDelhi is above all an historic city, an elegant capital, content to leave to Calcutta and Bombay the roles of commercial and business supremacy. It is in fact really two distinct cities; the energy and colour and the thronged bazaars and Moghul architecture of Old Delhi contrast with the formal splendour of New Delhi, whose wide boulevards offer ever-changing perspectives of Lutyen’s landscaped city. Delhi has several world-famous luxury hotels, with the comfort and style to ensure relaxation after your journey; from here, set forth to experience the sights and sounds of the city. The gracious Red Fort, the Jama Masjid (the largest mosque in India), the Qutab Minar complex with its soaring tower – all are waiting to be explored. Allows some time to wander round the inexpensive modern shops and handicraft centres. Magicians and dancing bears entertain crowds in the marketplaces, while fortune tellers may offer glimpses of the future. The heat of the day gives way to balmy evenings; enjoy a meal in one of the many splendid restaurants, the exotic music of sitars and veenas and the subtle rhythms of the tabla accompanying the delicious cuisines from throughout the country. Flights and trains and buses run from Delhi all over north India, so it is always easy to reach the next destination.\n\nWest India – The Warm West\n\nAfter the vibrant atmosphere of Bombay, allow the palm-fringed beaches of Goa to warm your spirit in the sun and relax your mind. Or meditate in cool and ancient Buddhist caves tunneled out of solid rock on the craggy hillsides – a dramatic contrast from the colourful fairs and festivals in unspoiled Gujarat. The choice is once again tremendous in this land that offers everything.\n\nMumbai – Gateway of India\n\nThere is a powerful life force at work in this thriving, modern commercial city, with its plate-glass skyscrapers and hectic colorful street life. The pace and confusion is vibrant, with businessmen hurrying to work, hooting traffic, fisherwomen in their bright sarees and ‘tiffinwallahs’ hurrying with their metal containers to deliver the businessman’s lunch direct from his home to his office. After relaxing on Chowpatty beach under the cool evening sky, sipping refreshing milk from a large green coconut, you will start to love Bombay. You will feel ready to visit the elegant and world famous Taj Mahal hotel for a delicious snack or drink while watching the sunset over the many boats in the harbour. In the luxury and quiet of a hotel room, sightseeing can be planned. Consider a visit to the lofty Hanging Gardens next door to the intriguing Towers of Silence; or maybe win a million at the beautiful Mahalaxmi Racecourse, one of the finest in India. A glamorous day visiting the famous Bombay film studios can be arranged, and perhaps a chat with one of the many film stars. Relive the ancient stories of the Hindu gods sculpted on the walls of caves at Elephanta. This well known island, where monkeys scamper across your path, is a short and pleasant boat ride from the famous landmark in Mumbai – the Gateway of India. When ready to leave this city of tycoons, commerce, skyscrapers and film stars, prepare for adventures of a very different kind which await at its doorstep.\n\nSouth India – A Heritage of Centuries\n\nThe delightful south; almost untouched by invasions throughout its history, the Indian heritage is more intact here than in other regions of the country. This is a land of temples, a land of the devout where new wonders await – the profusion of orange flowers, the shade of the banyan tree, and the soft beat of distant drums as yet another festival starts…\n\nChennai – A Kaleidoscope of Moods Chennai is the centre of the Hindu tradition of Bharata Natyam (classical dancing) the art of temple sculpture also comes from this part of the country, and gives expression to both the devoutness and the artistic skills of the Tamil people. Chennai is the home of the ancient Dravidian civilisation, one of the oldest articulate cultures in the world. It is a city where the landscape of the past lives easily with more recent history. This busy, efficient metropolis is a good centre to plan a journey over South India. Make use of the international and domestic airport and the massive network of trains and buses. The friendliness, sincerity and colourfulness of the people can slowly be absorbed while taking a stroll over the sandy stretch of beach known as the Marina, or visiting Fort St. George, built by the British East India Company. So many of the street names reflect the city’s long association with other cultures; China Bazar Road, Armenian Street, Portuguese Church Street for instance. In 78 AD, the Apostle St Thomas was martyred in the city, but the Christian faith now finds graceful expression in the many churches, particularly the San Thome Cathedral. View the whole panorama from the Chennai lighthouse, or experience the culture from ground level in the temples, art galleries or museums. Head off in any direction from Chennai – even east, across the Bay of Bengal by boat or plane to Port Blair in the Andaman Islands; a paradise archipelago, lush and forested, home of some of the most exotic plant-life in the world. The crystal clear waters shimmer with tropical fish, and the islands are famous for their corals and water-sports facilities. North of Chennai is the large state of Andhra Pradesh, rich in archeological and architectural treasures. The capital, Hyderabad, was once the seat of the fabled Nizams. The Charminar is a national symbol, and the Salar Jung Museum a rich repository of the Raj.\n\nEast India – Excitement and Tranquillity\n\nIn no time at all the stimulating bustle and heat of Calcutta is left far behind, opening out to the cool and luscious mountains of refreshing Darjeeling. Encounter the mighty range of the Himalayas in Sikkim, the one-horned rhinoceros in wonderful wildlife reserves, then dream of a forgotten age in the ancient holy towns on the plains of rural India.\n\nDiscover the Soul of Calcutta\n\nCalcutta is the largest city in India, indeed one of the largest in the world. Established as a British trading post in the 17th century, the city rapidly grew, acquiring a life and vibrancy of its own. Its glory is still reflected in the buildings of Chowringhee and Clive Street, know as Jawaharlal Nehru Road and Netaji Subhash Road respectively. It is a city which leaves no-one indifferent-fascinating, effervescent, teeming with life, peoples, cultures. The impact can be a shock at first; the rickshaws, cars, brightly painted lorries, trolley buses, the cries of the street vendors, labourers hard at work on the construction of the vast underground railway, the noise and colour of the huge New Market, the bustle of the crowds…but soon the jumbled impressions will sort themselves out. Central Calcutta is best viewed in perspective around the rolling green of the Maidan, 3 square kilometres of parkland where the early-morning yoga sessions provide for the city dwellers a relaxation from the stresses of urban life. For relaxation of another kind, visit the Indian Museum, one of the finest in Asia. Other attractions include the huge white marble Victoria Memorial, the Octherlony Monument and the headquarters of the Rama Krishna mission. To the north of the city is the silent beauty of the Belur Math and, across the river, the Botanical gardens (with a 200 years old Banyan tree, reputedly the largest in the world) and the Kali temple of Dakshineshwar."},{title:"Addiction When Gambling Becomes A Problem",body:"While most people enjoy casino gambling, sports betting, lottery and bingo playing for the fun and excitement it provides, others may experience gambling as an addictive and distractive habit. Statistics show that while 85 percent of the adult population in the US enjoys some type of gambling every year, between 2 and 3 percent of will develop a gambling problem and 1 percent of them are diagnosed as pathological gamblers. Where can you draw the line between harmless gambling to problem gambling? How can you tell if you or your friend are compulsive gamblers? Here you can find answers to these questions and other questions regarding problem gambling and gambling addiction. What is the Meaning of Problem Gambling?\n\nProblem gambling or compulsive gambling is defined as an uncontrollable urge to gamble despite the destructive effect of gambling on the gamblers life and despite feelings of guilt and remorse. Problem gambling tends to have a negative effect on the gamblers financial state, relationships and daily life. Severe cases of problem gambling can be defined as pathological gambling.

Can Anyone Become a Compulsive Gambler?\n\nTheoretically, yes. Any gambler can develop gambling problem regardless to the type of gambling he is occupied with, the amount of money and time he is spending on gambling. Researches show that slot machines that can be found in bars and convenient stores are the most addictive type of gambling activity, while lottery draws and bingo games are located on the other end of the scale. Gambling addiction is an emotional problem; its symptoms, causes and treatments are similar to any other form of addiction. How Can I treat Gambling Addiction?\n\n1) Group Therapy:\n\nGamblers Anonymous offers a 12 step self help program similar to the one offered to alcohol addicts in Alcoholics Anonymous. Group therapy also offers gambling addicts advice and support from professional counselors and other gambling addicts in different phases of their recovery process. Gambler Anonymous centers are available in more than 1,200 locations statewide.\n\n2) Individual Therapy:\n\nCognitive or behavior therapy can help gambling addicts to identify their unaware thinking and acting patterns, which led them to gamble compulsively, and to replace them with controllable and healthier ways of thinking.\n\n3) Psychiatric Medication:\n\nIt has recently been proven that antidepressant medications from the family of SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be affective in treatment of gambling addicts."},{title:"Maui Hotel Or Maui Condo",body:"Maui hotel or Maui condo? It’s the burning question on everyones mind! What should you do? Maui hotel? Maui condo? Which should you choose? The sweat is pouring down your face and you can feel the pressure building…Okay! Okay! Maybe it’s not that burning, after all! It is, however, a very important decision if you are planning a Maui vacation.\n\nThe answer depends on what you are planning to do on Maui. If you are going to Maui for just a few days, you will probably want to get a hotel room. Most hotels have very minimum stay requirements, if any. You can just check-in for a night or two and be on your way. They also have daily maid service to keep your room clean and fresh.\n\nIf you are looking for a longer stay, you will probably want to stay in a condo. Most condos have a minimum stay requirement, especially if you stay in a privately owned condo. Most private owners require you to stay a minimum of 7 nights. During holidays, the requirement may be as much as 14 nights. I know of a few owners that will allow a 5 night minimum stay but very few allow less than 5 nights.\n\nIf you want to do your own cooking to save some money while you are on Maui, you will want to stay in a condo. Most hotels will have a bare minimum as far as kitchens go while condos will have a completely furnished kitchen. The majority of the people I book for Maui accommodations want to cook at least a few meals in the thier unit so they almost always book Maui condos.\n\nWhat do I recommend? I always recommend staying in a Maui condo! They are like a home away from home; although some of them may even be bigger than your home. They are fully furnished, they tend to have more room and you can wow everyone with your Maui vacation culinary skills!"},{title:"Get Ready Fast For Fall Leaf Viewing Trips",body:"Whether its a driving tour, a cruise or a bus, leaf viewing is a great way to spend a fall vacation. It’s also big tour business and the are many options. As you dream of that hot apple cider on a crisp afternoon do a quick check list before you leave home so you’re ready for any type of weather. If you’re prepared then all you need to do is focus on having a fun and relaxing time.\n\nStart preparing by taking out your favorite sweater. Think “chilly.” Pack one that you can use outdoors as well as under a rain jacket or sitting inside by a warm fire. It’s also time to get back into socks after a summer in sandals. A few pair of them should be on your list. Pack four pair and add a fifth one that is woolen or made for winter.\n\nLayering clothes is paramount for fall trips outdoors. The sudden sunny burst in the afternoon versus breath chilling mornings can surprise anyone. A nice light weight fleece top with a wind proof jacket works well. Pack both.\n\nWhile we think of blue cloudless skies on an autumn afternoon the chance of rain is pretty high so pack a rain suit. A jacket with a hood and pants are best. When outside all day in the wet and damp its important to keep dry all over for comfort and a complete rainsuit is the answer. Today’s styles and fabrics come in all colors and patterns so you can be stylish as well as comfortable.\n\nMake sure to add a small folding umbrella to your bag as well. Raincoats are fine but unless its full length with a zip in liner, rainy weather can start to feel downright uncomfortable by mid afternoon. Its miserable by evening unless you are warm from head to toe. An umbrella can help.\n\nPack a warm hat and gloves. Comfortable shoes are also a must and if they also happen to be waterproof its a big plus at this time of year.\n\nYour camera gear needs to be in good working order so check it at home before you leave. Take extra batteries and memory cards. Film can be bought along the road if you want to travel light. Double check you camera bag and make sure it’s moisture proof. If at all possible avoid taking a brand new camera since anything untried can miss these great photos you’ll want to show off once you get back home.\n\nHowever you are traveling you’ll be on the move a lot, always more than you think, since you have to be outdoors to see foilage. Being mobile in your traveling will allow you greater freedom and flexibility. Pack light and put all your items into a single, carryable, soft side bag. Take a day pack for those daily viewing excursions and make sure you put a bottle of drinkng water inside. Take prescriptions in original bottles and always pack more than you will need. Binoculars are not required but can be a great joy if you happen to catch birds migrating or wildlife grazing before the first snowfall.\n\nAs long as you have the right gear you can travel anywhere anytime of the year.

According to its noted author, Dr. Jarn Leffer, “IT is a ‘must-see’ for those with little time on their hands & a passionate interest in Innocuous Things.”\n\nMost linear thinkers have a great deal of difficulty even comprehending why on earth someone in their “right mind” would be interested in visiting a planet called “IT”. Not being a linear thinker with an investment in the “right” answer, I didn’t give a hoot. After all, what does one (who walks on water & listens to miffed mortals all day long) do for a frigging night off, now I ask you?\n\nAs planets go, “IT” is a ho-hum celestial pit-stop with perhaps one exception. the welcome notice that reads, “Cosmic Cowboys – Welcome to the furthest unexplored outreaches of the Galaxy . Home to the Flop Fairy & Oodles of Gadflies!”\n\n“IT” is populated by colonies of giggling, green grasshoppers . What else would you expect to inhabit a far-flung, fantasy-challenged hellhole like this? But, what made “IT” strictly speaking a strange place was the fact that the inhabitants munch on green, biodegradable garbage bags for fun. Lacking masticating capabilities, the gadflies process their food by vigorously jumping up & down on it. No wonder they have no need for fast-food franchises, strip malls or landfills!\n\nTo put “IT” bluntly, life on “IT” is shy of a tittynope*. The jolly green grasshoppers & the carefully manicured green fairways with sand traps as far as the eye can see certainly make for an utterly harmless world. Regrettably, without a pair of golf clubs, a dimpled white ball, & the notion that 19th hole even exists on this planet — “IT” is about as fun as bag of toads!\n\nAnyway, I picked up this picturesque postcard of the blessed ballyhooing buglugs. they look perfectly happy but don’t be deceived. In reality, they are a gang of glad-handing grasshoppers. they don’t play golf, eat burgers, or drink beer — & none can frost a rock! Come to think of it, apart from the company of bugs & the elusive flop fairy, this pathetic planet has precious little going for IT!!\n\nLife Lesson 42: Remember to talk to your travel agent before ever embarking on a flight of fancy to a planet called “IT” in a galaxy named “Have-a-Nice-Day”!! __________\n\nIf you need to know what those green, glad-handing grasshoppers from “IT” look like — ask any four-year old, or failing that request some help from a Flying Saucer Club member.\n\n*”Tittynope” for you whiffling word-peckers means “a small quantity of anything left over”."},{title:"Five Tips For Low Cost Holidays",body:"The availability of low-cost flights and last minute internet deals means that cheap holidays are far easier to come by than they used to be, but it can still take a bit of shopping around to get the best discounts.\n\n1. Fly from further afield\n\nThis may sound silly, but by widening your choice of departure airport, you could save a lot of money. The larger airports carry more flights and that allows airlines to keep prices low. By flying from a bigger UK airport such as Manchester, Stanstead, Heathrow or Gatwick, you could save a lot of money on your flights.\n\n2. Travel out of season\n\nIf you’re not bound by school holidays, take the opportunity to travel out of season and fly during the week rather than at weekends. Flights are often cheaper during these times in order to encourage travel, so think about leaving on a Thursday rather than a Friday and see what a difference it could make to the price.\n\n3. Register for updates\n\nCheap discount holiday travel companies often operate newsletters or email updates to let you know about special offers and last minute deals. Registering for these communications gives you advance information about discount travel, allowing you to take advantage of offers that suit you.\n\n4. Find hotel reviews\n\nCheap holiday hotels aren’t always good. It’s best to get as much information as you can from the travel company and to go online to look for reviews. This is a great way to find out if you’re booking a great little budget hotel or a place that could spoil your holiday.\n\n5. Book online\n\nYou can often get discounts on flights, hotels, car hire and holiday packages if you book online. Make sure that the site you’re booking with has a secure payment system and that you print off your confirmation so that you can call the company with any queries or problems. Use reputable discount holiday travel sites and you could get your holiday for a much cheaper price than on the high street.\n\nIt is possible to get great cheap discount holiday travel with a little bit of research and a flexible approach to travel times."},{title:"Motorhome Or Trailer",body:"Motorhome or Trailer that is the question for you. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of both, so you will be confident when purchasing an RV. When comparing Rvs, a motorhome or a travel trailer, should you buy a motorhome or fifth wheeler? The advantages and disadvantages of both are studied so that you can make your choice wisely when purchasing an RV. Possessing a motorhome or fifth wheel is an achievement of a lifetime. It can be similar to sojourning with your residence as you search the various sites of our great land, America.\n\nThe two commonly known recreational vehicle classes are the motorized and towable. Towable rvs are the travel trailers and the fifth wheel. The rv travel trailer or fifth wheel has the attraction of getting towed by a pickup or a car, thus giving the adaptability of possessing transportation for you when you are parked at your campsite. \n\nA motorhome is a recreational vehicle that is motorized. It has three categories which can either be gas, diesel or Diesel Pushers which are the most costly ones. Converted vans that are large and self-sustaining represent the smaller types of motorhomes and then there are the ones that are built on the chassis of a truck.. The motorized motor home needs a tow car for your transportation after you set up in your campsite.\n\nRvs are styled to your specifications for the best appearance and luxuries you anticipate when possessing an rv. High standard artisanship, venues for entertainment, and keenness to small bits of information can be applied into an rv bearing in mind that each and every amenity comes with a price tag.\n\nA travel trailer or fifth wheel is larger inside than a motorhome of the same size because of the driving area, i.e. a 40 foot trailer or fifth wheel has more livable space than a 40 foot motorhome. Towing a trailer with a car puts a lot of wear and tear on the automobile because they are usually not equipped for heavy duty towing.\n\nThe motor home is definitely more money because you are paying for the driving mechanism and chassis. Trailers and motorhomes can be equipped with the same options. So the question seems to be do I want to travel in a truck pulling a large fifth wheel or ride in a motorhome pulling a tow car. One thing is certain if you talk to a motorhome owner he will tell you that you should definitely purchase a motorhome and the same goes for a travel trailer or fifth wheel owner, he thinks the trailer is the only way to go.  No matter what you choose the experiences are out of this world."

And, in some ways, they’re right. Traveling can be expensive. But by taking the time to learn about discounts readily available to everyone through the internet, newspapers, and even the yellow pages, more families can venture off on vacations that will recharge their batteries, stimulate their minds, and create memories to last a lifetime.\n\nAirfare can be one of the most costly and unavoidable aspects of travel. Air travelers are constantly in search of a good deal. Numerous methods exist to get discounts on your next ticket. First, leave or return in the middle of the week      "},{title:"How To Fly A Private Jet On Your Next Trip",body:"It is now possible to charter, rent or lease an aircraft for less than ever before and it has also become easier.\n\nWhy charter an aircraft? Here are some good reasons:\n\nThe increased security and hassle of commercial airline boarding.\n\nThere are fewer airlines around.\n\nFewer airlines are flying to fewer cities\n\nBecause of economy restraints there are fewer seats for more passengers.\n\nIt is now easier to charter, lease or rent a plane because there are more companies entering the aircraft leasing business.\n\nAlso, a new generation of small jets is being produced as we speak, the so-called air taxis seating between 4 to 6 passengers for a total airplane cost of as low as 1 million dollars.\n\nThese small jets are being produced in a so-called cookie-cutter design, 100 at a time and are also being purchased 100 at a time.\n\nReal Air Taxis will soon be on their way into major cities,” says London based AVCEN. Avcen is to bring its innovative Jetpod aircraft design off the drawing board and into proof-of-concept build and flight trials.\n\nThe Jetpod is a unique, lightweight, Very Quiet Short Take-Off and Landing (VQSTOL), 6-seat, twin-jet powered aircraft.\n\nThe Jetpod cruises at 350 mph and uses an unbelievable 410 feet of landing space. This is achieved through a combination of horizontal and vertical thrust management as developed by Avcen.\n\nNo runways are required so you can take off from a private parking lot or your neighbor’s driveway.\n\nThere are similar small jets being manufactured in the US as well.\n\nAircraft Charter companies provide the following 4 functions in a variety of innovative ways:\n\nRenting (sometimes selling) aircraft for private use, performing aircraft maintenance, providing fuel, and aircraft management. The best way of finding an aircraft charter company is on line. You can also contact an aircraft charter broker who will sort of act as your airplane travel agent.\n\nThey will handle all of your flight arrangements, including price comparisons, they will determine the correct aircraft for your trip,they will locate the correct charter company, make sure insurance is in place, and obtain copies of FAA flight certificates.\n\nThere are also aircraft charter auctions available on the Web.\n\nUsing a unique online auction, your trip itinerary is instantly sent to a network of pre-approved jet operators who are invited to bid on your trip. This increases competition and ultimately drives the price down. You can view this bidding action live, online.\n\nFleet Membership allows you to buy occupied flight time in your preferred category of business jet in blocks of whatever flight hours you want with guaranteed availability. You enjoy the freedom and convenience of business jet travel without the costs or commitment of aircraft ownership.\n\nOne Ways and Empty Leg Flights When a one way aircraft charter flight is booked, many times the aircraft has to return to it’s original airport. In a case like this, the plane will be flying empty. This is known as an empty leg. Because the aircraft charter operators like to make money if possible, they offer these empty legs for much less than a typical charter would cost.\n\nFlying in a Private Jet has become a Status Symbol.\n\nOne of the perks most valued to CEO’s and lawmakers today is to have the use of a Private Jet. This is another reason why the Charter Aircraft business is at present growing at an astonishing rate which will increase even more as the air taxis costing one million dollars or so will enter service."},{title:"Traveling To Barcelona",body:"When you type the website name on your address bar, a simple yet classy homepage of the website unfurls right before your eyes.

But with a little budgeting and research, you can enjoy a luxury vacation even on a tight budget. After all, you’ve worked hard all year long, and your vacation should be a relaxing, fun experience. Here are some travel tips to help you budget for your global travel and vacations and find great deals on luxury resorts around the world.\n\nCreate a Vacation Savings Plan\n\nInstead of trying to gather up enough money for vacation at the last minute, develop a savings plan at the start of each year. Save only $20 per week and you’ll have $1040.00 after 12 months. This can take care of the hotel bill and maybe more if you find a great bargain!\n\nSave Money on Food\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go shopping for groceries. Note: Be sure the hotel or resort provides a refrigerator and microwave or stove. Save your “dining out” money for a few really special evenings out. This will allow you to enjoy a few delicious meals instead of wasting dollars on fast food every day. One family-of-four meal at a fast food restaurant could cost $30 USD or more!\n\nReserve in Advance\n\nIf you know far enough in advance where and when you will take your holiday, you can book your hotel and flight in advance and receive savings. Phone the hotel or resort where you would like to stay several months ahead and ask them to mail their latest brochure to you. Often times the brochures will contain rates for certain dates along with coupons. You can take advantage of “early bird” or “off-season” discounts.\n\nGet to Know Local or Online Travel Agents\n\nContact local travel agents in your area and ask to be notified when special deals arise. They are willing to help because they get paid a commission. Also, ask about brochures to various luxury resorts around the world so you can get an idea of where you would like to go.\n\nYou can also join with a travel group online to receive enormous discounts on four and five star luxury resorts in Europe, Asia, Greece, Egypt, Israel, and many other destinations. Whether you’d like to stay at a beach resort, ski resort, golf resort, or take ocean cruises, they will do the research for you using their years of expertise. For even more savings, you can also sell global travel and vacations or memberships to others through a travel group and earn money. This allows you to work at home with your very own travel business or at least pay for your own vacation!\n\nPlan Activities Online\n\nOnce you know your destination, you can plan some of the more expensive activities online in advance to enjoy Internet savings. Popular amusement parks, museums, and entertainment venues often give a discount for ordering tickets online in advance.\n\nSave on Air Fare\n\nIf traveling by plane, try bidding on tickets to get a good price or look for departure times that offer cheaper rates. Many airlines cost less during the off-seasons as well.\n\nNo matter what your travel budget, you can enjoy a great vacation if you do enough advance planning. Make the most of your holiday while spending less!"},{title:"Selecting The Right Hotel",body:"So you’re going abroad, you’ve chosen your destination and now you have to choose a hotel. Ten years ago, you’d have probably visited your local travel agent and trusted the face-to-face advice you were given by the so called ‘experts’. The 21st Century way to select and book your hotel is of course on the Internet, by using travel websites. But how do you sift through the amazing choices on offer? And more importantly, do you really trust the photographs and descriptions of the hotels that they have awarded themselves with the motivation of getting bookings? Traveler reviews can be helpful, but you need to exercise caution. They are often biased, sometimes out of date, and may not serve your interests at all. How do you know that the features that are important to the reviewer are important to you? Then there’s the problem of the reviewer’s motivation. The more reviews you read, the more you notice how they tend to cluster at the extremes of opinion. On one end, you have angry reviewers with axes to grind; at the other, you have delighted guests who lavish praise beyond belief. You’ll not be surprised to learn that hotels sometimes post their own glowing reviews, or that competitor’s line up for the chance to lambaste the competition with bad reviews. It makes sense to consider what is really important to you when selecting a hotel. You should then choose an online hotel directory that gives up-to-date, independent, impartial information that really matters.\n\nHere are some of the key facts you should bear in mind:\n\n1. Location: if it matters that your hotel is, for example, on the beach, close to the theme park, or convenient for the airport, then location is paramount. Any decent directory should offer a location map of the hotel and its surroundings. There should be distance charts to the airport offered as well as some form of interactive map.\n\n2. Style: it is important to choose a hotel that makes you feel comfortable – contemporary or traditional furnishings, local decor or international, formal or relaxed. The ideal hotel directory should let you know of the options available.\n\n3. Restaurants, Cafes and Bars: local color is great but the hotel’s own restaurants and bars can play an important part in your stay. You should be aware of choice, style and whether or not they are smart or informal. A good hotel report should tell you this, and particularly about breakfast facilities.\n\n4. Bedroom Facilities: you should always carefully consider the type of facilities you need from your bedroom and find the hotel that has those you consider important. The hotel directory website should elaborate on matters such as: bed size, Internet Access (its cost, whether there is WIFI or wired broadband connection), Complimentary amenities, views from the room and luxury offerings like a Pillow menu or Bath menu, choice of smoking or non smoking rooms etc.\n\nThese things really do matter and any decent hotel directory should give you this sort of advice on bedrooms – not just the number of rooms which is the usual option!\n\n5. Children’s’ Facilities: more important to the family traveler than the business traveler, you should find out just how child friendly the hotel is from the directory and make your decision from there. One thing worth looking for is whether the hotel offers a baby sitters service. For the business traveler wishing to escape children this is of course very relevant too – perhaps a hotel that is not child friendly would be something more appropriate!\n\n6. Leisure Facilities: the site should offer a detailed analysis of leisure services within the hotel – spa, pool, gym, sauna – as well as details of any other facilities nearby such as golf courses. 7. Special Needs: the hotel directory site should advise the visitor of each hotel’s special needs services and accessibility policy. Whilst again this does not apply to every visitor, it is absolutely vital to some.\n\nFinally and most importantly, the quality hotel directory inspection team should have visited the hotel in question on a regular basis, met the staff, slept in a bedroom and tried the food. They should experience the hotel as only a hotel guest can and it is only then that they are really in a strong position to write about the hotel."},{title:"Cdc Issues Health Alert Notice For Travelers To Usa From Hon",body:"The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) on Saturday began distributing cards at airports receiving flights returning directly from Hong Kong warning travelers returning to the United States from Hong Kong & Guangdong Province, People’s Republic of China & Hanoi, Vietnam that they may have been exposed to cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nThe cards are being handed out by quarantine officials at Chicago, O’Hare International Airport; Los Angeles; old York City, JFK International Airport; Newark; & San Francisco.

Aircraft passengers & crew should be informed of the person’s status as a suspect case of SARS;"},{title:"Travelagent India",body:"Namaskar, welcome to Incredible India, where culture echoes, tradition speaks, beauty enthralls and diversity delights.\n\nBounded by the majestic Himalayan ranges in the north and edged by an endless stretch of golden beaches, India is a vivid kaleidoscope of landscapes, magnificent historical sites and royal cities, misty mountain retreats, colorful people, rich cultures and festivities. The timeless mystery and beauty of India has been waiting for you for 5000 years, always warm and inviting, a place of infinite variety – one that favors you with different facets of its fascination every time you visit India.\n\nvisit the four corners of India: North India, South India, East India, West India\n\nNorth India – Land of Romance\n\nYou’ve arrived at Delhi. The months of planning and curiosity are over; you’re actually in India. Every experience, every sound, every smell shouts that you’ve arrived somewhere magical, somewhere Special. It is here that the deep love of one man for one woman created the Taj Mahal; where the King of Kings ruled; where the sacred Ganges flows past holy cities; where the Himalayas stand silent and magnificent; where 5000 years of culture waits to be absorbed.\n\nDelhi – the Old and the New\n\nDelhi is above all an historic city, an elegant capital, content to leave to Calcutta and Bombay the roles of commercial and business supremacy. It is in fact really two distinct cities; the energy and colour and the thronged bazaars and Moghul architecture of Old Delhi contrast with the formal splendour of New Delhi, whose wide boulevards offer ever-changing perspectives of Lutyen’s landscaped city. Delhi has several world-famous luxury hotels, with the comfort and style to ensure relaxation after your journey; from here, set forth to experience the sights and sounds of the city. The gracious Red Fort, the Jama Masjid (the largest mosque in India), the Qutab Minar complex with its soaring tower – all are waiting to be explored. Allows some time to wander round the inexpensive modern shops and handicraft centres. Magicians and dancing bears entertain crowds in the marketplaces, while fortune tellers may offer glimpses of the future. The heat of the day gives way to balmy evenings; enjoy a meal in one of the many splendid restaurants, the exotic music of sitars and veenas and the subtle rhythms of the tabla accompanying the delicious cuisines from throughout the country. Flights and trains and buses run from Delhi all over north India, so it is always easy to reach the next destination.\n\nWest India – The Warm West\n\nAfter the vibrant atmosphere of Bombay, allow the palm-fringed beaches of Goa to warm your spirit in the sun and relax your mind. Or meditate in cool and ancient Buddhist caves tunneled out of solid rock on the craggy hillsides – a dramatic contrast from the colourful fairs and festivals in unspoiled Gujarat. The choice is once again tremendous in this land that offers everything.\n\nMumbai – Gateway of India\n\nThere is a powerful life force at work in this thriving, modern commercial city, with its plate-glass skyscrapers and hectic colorful street life. The pace and confusion is vibrant, with businessmen hurrying to work, hooting traffic, fisherwomen in their bright sarees and ‘tiffinwallahs’ hurrying with their metal containers to deliver the businessman’s lunch direct from his home to his office. After relaxing on Chowpatty beach under the cool evening sky, sipping refreshing milk from a large green coconut, you will start to love Bombay. You will feel ready to visit the elegant and world famous Taj Mahal hotel for a delicious snack or drink while watching the sunset over the many boats in the harbour. In the luxury and quiet of a hotel room, sightseeing can be planned. Consider a visit to the lofty Hanging Gardens next door to the intriguing Towers of Silence; or maybe win a million at the beautiful Mahalaxmi Racecourse, one of the finest in India. A glamorous day visiting the famous Bombay film studios can be arranged, and perhaps a chat with one of the many film stars. Relive the ancient stories of the Hindu gods sculpted on the walls of caves at Elephanta. This well known island, where monkeys scamper across your path, is a short and pleasant boat ride from the famous landmark in Mumbai – the Gateway of India. When ready to leave this city of tycoons, commerce, skyscrapers and film stars, prepare for adventures of a very different kind which await at its doorstep.\n\nSouth India – A Heritage of Centuries\n\nThe delightful south; almost untouched by invasions throughout its history, the Indian heritage is more intact here than in other regions of the country. This is a land of temples, a land of the devout where new wonders await – the profusion of orange flowers, the shade of the banyan tree, and the soft beat of distant drums as yet another festival starts…\n\nChennai – A Kaleidoscope of Moods Chennai is the centre of the Hindu tradition of Bharata Natyam (classical dancing) the art of temple sculpture also comes from this part of the country, and gives expression to both the devoutness and the artistic skills of the Tamil people. Chennai is the home of the ancient Dravidian civilisation, one of the oldest articulate cultures in the world. It is a city where the landscape of the past lives easily with more recent history. This busy, efficient metropolis is a good centre to plan a journey over South India. Make use of the international and domestic airport and the massive network of trains and buses. The friendliness, sincerity and colourfulness of the people can slowly be absorbed while taking a stroll over the sandy stretch of beach known as the Marina, or visiting Fort St. George, built by the British East India Company. So many of the street names reflect the city’s long association with other cultures; China Bazar Road, Armenian Street, Portuguese Church Street for instance. In 78 AD, the Apostle St Thomas was martyred in the city, but the Christian faith now finds graceful expression in the many churches, particularly the San Thome Cathedral. View the whole panorama from the Chennai lighthouse, or experience the culture from ground level in the temples, art galleries or museums. Head off in any direction from Chennai – even east, across the Bay of Bengal by boat or plane to Port Blair in the Andaman Islands; a paradise archipelago, lush and forested, home of some of the most exotic plant-life in the world. The crystal clear waters shimmer with tropical fish, and the islands are famous for their corals and water-sports facilities. North of Chennai is the large state of Andhra Pradesh, rich in archeological and architectural treasures. The capital, Hyderabad, was once the seat of the fabled Nizams. The Charminar is a national symbol, and the Salar Jung Museum a rich repository of the Raj.\n\nEast India – Excitement and Tranquillity\n\nIn no time at all the stimulating bustle and heat of Calcutta is left far behind, opening out to the cool and luscious mountains of refreshing Darjeeling. Encounter the mighty range of the Himalayas in Sikkim, the one-horned rhinoceros in wonderful wildlife reserves, then dream of a forgotten age in the ancient holy towns on the plains of rural India.\n\nDiscover the Soul of Calcutta\n\nCalcutta is the largest city in India, indeed one of the largest in the world. Established as a British trading post in the 17th century, the city rapidly grew, acquiring a life and vibrancy of its own. Its glory is still reflected in the buildings of Chowringhee and Clive Street, know as Jawaharlal Nehru Road and Netaji Subhash Road respectively. It is a city which leaves no-one indifferent-fascinating, effervescent, teeming with life, peoples, cultures. The impact can be a shock at first; the rickshaws, cars, brightly painted lorries, trolley buses, the cries of the street vendors, labourers hard at work on the construction of the vast underground railway, the noise and colour of the huge New Market, the bustle of the crowds…but soon the jumbled impressions will sort themselves out. Central Calcutta is best viewed in perspective around the rolling green of the Maidan, 3 square kilometres of parkland where the early-morning yoga sessions provide for the city dwellers a relaxation from the stresses of urban life. For relaxation of another kind, visit the Indian Museum, one of the finest in Asia. Other attractions include the huge white marble Victoria Memorial, the Octherlony Monument and the headquarters of the Rama Krishna mission. To the north of the city is the silent beauty of the Belur Math and, across the river, the Botanical gardens (with a 200 years old Banyan tree, reputedly the largest in the world) and the Kali temple of Dakshineshwar."},{title:"Cruising Destination Ideas",body:"Admit it. Before you took that first cruise, your thoughts about cruise ships and cruise vacations consisted of flashbacks to Love Boat re-runs. Cruising was all about sunny, tropical destinations like Bermuda, Mexico and Hawaii. Since traveling by cruise ship is more popular than ever before, thanks to its affordability, you can not only go to those sunny destinations but also to more unusual ports like Hong Kong, Alaska, Norway and the Amazon River. Still, a lot of cruising is done in warm weather. The Caribbean is one of the most popular places for first-time cruisers to go. Among the places to choose from are the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. There is also the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Usually, cruise ships heading for the Caribbean set sail from ports along the Eastern United States coast as well as Florida. The same applies to beautiful Bermuda. People who live on the West Coast of the United States often cruise to Hawaii and its islands. The main goal of some vacationers is simply to see the black sandy beaches of Punaluu. Cool Alaskan cruises are a big deal not only because of the sights but also because of the cool side trips that can be taken. Passengers can gaze at glaciers either by land, by helicopter or even a guided walking tour. They can go salmon fishing or relive some of the history of the Gold Rush days at some of the Alaskan ports. These cruises also offer up some wildlife in the process. Passengers have been known to spot humpback whales, moose, wolverines, sea lions and bears. If it is winter time in the United States, you can bet that veteran cruisers may be heading to places in South America like Rio de Janeiro or Buenos Aires to indulge in their summer seasons in an exotic locale. Some of the more adventurous may decide on an Amazonian cruise or choose to cruise the Galapagos Islands. The Indian Ocean may appeal to some with an eye for less commercialized ports of call. Some of these ports include African islands like Madagascar, the Seychelles and the Spice Islands. Plus, you could even extend your vacation to include a Kenyan safari. The Mediterranean Sea beckons to the cruisers who are history buffs. Some of the places rich in history include Italy and the ruins of Rome including the Colosseum. Greece is another popular Mediterranean destination seeped in history. The islands of Corfu and Crete are often included in a Grecian cruise. Visiting other parts of Europe are a must for those seeking a travel back through time. From Scottish castles to the Latin flavors of Barcelona, Spain, there is something for anyone. Deciding where to go is one of the hardest parts of cruise travel. For a lot of us, budget dictates where we can go. Want a warm, sunny place or a cool cruise to Alaska? No matter what your pocketbook says, there are fabulous destinations to be cruised."},{title:"Online Games How To Play To Win",body:"Learn how to improve your playing quality and even overall understanding of online gaming and how you perform while playing online. Gaming online is a huge business nowadays and that means that there are millions of people worldwide at online game sites all the time. Many are people just like you and me that like to play online and have fun doing it. Some of these people enjoy it so much, that they often do not even care about improving their skill and raising their chances of winning.\n\nSo Why Should You Work on Your Game?\n\nWorking on skills will not only help you improve your success while playing online games but will also give you higher self-esteem and a sense of achievement. And remember that the faster you master the easy games, you can turn to the more complicated ones and match your brain and skills against the real experts.\n\nHow to Improve Your Online Gaming Skills?\n\nOnline playing is different than just playing on your personal computer at home. While online, you have to pay attention to many different things that need to be taken into account, and I will detail these here:\n\n1) Internet Connection: Pay attention to your online connection and make sure that the internet connection is strong and without any connection breaks. These can be done easily by trying to play a simple online game before moving on to the more serious ones. For example, play scrabbles or checkers online and then see how your connection works.\n\n2) The Graphics: Check that your PC screen is strong enough to run the specific game you have in mind. Download the trial and play it on your computer. If you can’t run or if it does not run smoothly, be aware that though the online version is less of a strain on the resources of your computer, the game might get stuck or stall from time to time. What can you do? Other than spending money on improving the hardware of your computer, the only thing you can do is to pick another game.\n\n3) Limit your game time: One of the most important facts that young players tend to overlook is that they cannot play forever. The body needs sleep and even though it might appear or one might not feel tired, your performance drops as the hours pass by. It is important also to (if the game permits it) try and drink water while playing and not Coca Cola or Pepsi or anything else sweet or alcoholic. These will only make you more sleepy than before even if for the first few minutes it will feel as if they are invigorating you.\n\n4) Game Plans: Have a look at how others are playing before you join the fray. Study the manner how the game moves and how others hide or move. Even if you end up playing against other players, eventually the nooks and corners of the game are similar. Remember that people tend to move in similar fashion so the whole point is to get a whiff of game movement.\n\n5) Strategy: Look up different strategic models and systems offered and posted on the internet. Your players might use some of these and if you are aware of them it will be easier for you to block their moves."
},{title:"Trip To Iqaluit In Nunavut A Canadian Arctic City",body:"In 2004, I completed two Inuit art buying trips to Iqaluit (formerly Frobisher Bay), the capital of Nunavut, Canada’s newest territory. For both trips, I flew out of Ottawa on Canadian North airlines. The other airline that services Nunavut is First Air. Only the last half of the jets was allocated for passengers as the entire first half was for cargo. Being so remote, Canadian Arctic Inuit communities pretty well have to have everything shipped up there by plane or by boat during the summers since there are no roads connecting to the rest of Canada or even between each Nunavut community. The Arctic landscape from the air was desolate, hilly and barren. As the plane got closer to Iqaluit, the airport’s small terminal building stood out with its bright yellow color. The airport itself is within walking distance to the rest of the town. There are taxis that charge a flat rate of $5 per trip anywhere in Iqaluit. Interestingly enough, these taxis also pick up and drop off other passengers along the way so shared rides with others are common here. There are several hotels in Iqaluit and rooms are generally clean, comfortable but quite basic. Accommodations and dining up north in Nunavut are both expensive. All food items with the exception of local Inuit fare must be flown up from the Canadian south. A carton of milk will cost about $10 in Iqaluit. Most Inuit locals cannot afford to buy overpriced fruits, vegetables and meat from the south. Many local families still rely on Inuit hunters who bring caribou, seal and whale to the table.\n\nThere is only one high rise building in Iqaluit and it is used mainly for local Nunavut government offices. All other buildings are low rise, including the hospital. The vast majority of the residential housing is similar to cabins that are raised off the ground because of the harsh Canadian Arctic winters. Many look a bit run down with junk and disposed items piled outside. With the fact that there are no lawns or trees possible this far north, the neighborhoods are certainly not the prettiest sights around. But one Inuit art carver told me that his government subsidized rent is only $36 per month. There are some small clusters of nice homes on the outskirts of town.  Some houses have husky dogs tied up outside and many have snowmobiles. In fact, the roads, most of them unpaved, are shared by cars, trucks, snowmobiles, all terrain vehicles and people. During the summers, Iqaluit can get quite dusty with all the vehicles turning up the dirt on the roads. As a result, Iqaluit did look a bit nicer during my first trip which was during the winter when the city was in white snow rather than brown dirt. There is new construction going on since with the creation of the Nunavut territory, Iqaluit is growing as more Inuit from other Arctic communities are migrating to the city. One thing that was very noticeable in Iqaluit was the large numbers of children everywhere. Nunavut has a very young population with 56% under the age of 25. I saw many Inuit mothers wearing traditional Inuit parkas with large hoods in the back where their babies are carried. The Inuit youth is one of the Canadian Arctic’s untapped resources and its future. They have access to satellite television and dress just like their counterparts in the south. However, at present only about 25% of high school students graduate so a big challenge for the Nunavut government is to encourage the Inuit kids to stay in school. During my second trip, there was darkness for only a few hours each day so it was very strange to be walking around town at 10 pm in the evening with daylight still present. Even at this hour, there were still quite a few young Inuit children playing outside. The locals, Inuit and non-Inuit alike were very friendly. I got the impression of a tight community perhaps because of the isolation of the Canadian Arctic. However, the local Inuit were also very open to visitors and willing to share a bit of their lives. During the daytime, I went up to a few Inuit art carvers who were working outside their houses. Each turned off their power saws when I approached them and seemed happy to talk to me. I met most of them later during the evenings when they showed me their finished works of Inuit art. \n\nI had the opportunity to walk about 30 minutes to the outskirts of town past the airport one day. I climbed up a hilltop with a satellite dish facility overlooking an expansive valley. There was nobody else around and it was incredible how silent the area was. It was like a vacuum where I could hear only my own breathing. It was a very peaceful and even spiritual moment there. While sitting on this Arctic hilltop, I was suddenly startled at one point by a noise and it turned out to be the flapping wings of a large raven flying by. There are tours offered by local outfitters to see the northern wildlife and experience some of the Arctic tundra further out. I hope to take one of these tours on a future visit. A trip to Nunavut is not cheap since everything, including flights are so expensive. However, I will definitely return not only for more Inuit art, but also to experience more of the local Inuit culture and the Arctic land."},{title:"Mother Earth Hosts Our Travels",body:"As conscious traveling Paupers we must always be concerned about our dear Mother Earth.

In most cases, if you decide to fly the formerly affable skies, your airline or airport website will have an accurate and up to date list regarding what is okay and what is not okay regarding your luggage. As if packing for a trip wasnt difficult enough, now we all have to do it with cloudy and blurry regulations and a list we print out from the airlines.\n\nThe first measure of travel complacency is simple; dont try to squeeze on a carry on that you know is not really a carry on. You will get yourself into the frustrating position of trying to argue your way onto the airplane with an large bag that just wont do. Youre not going to succeed. Once upon a time you would, but not anymore. Now, you will simply be forced to check it and risk being charged an additional fee for having too many luggage items. Plus, youre going to end up travelling without your usual band of comfort items that you could have had if you just scaled down into standard sized carry on luggage. The simple fact is that there used to be wiggle room, and now, there is none.\n\nMost airlines limit luggage by the length of the flight. A domestic flight may accept 2 pieces of luggage plus one carry one per person (sometimes including and sometimes excluding persons under 4 years of age) while others limit the baggage content to one piece of checked luggage and one carry on. Additional pieces of luggage run anywhere from $50 to $200, depending on the airline and the size of the flight and while mess of miscellaneous stuff they dont release to the public. Airlines have been struggling since the disaster of 9-11. Some will make up the continued lost revenue anyway they can, including charging phenomenal fees for additional luggage. It is just cheaper to have your extra necessary luggage shipped, even overnighted, if you just cant do without it. World-wide flights often hold the same code, two pieces of checked in luggage and one or two carry on pieces per person. Again, the child may not be granted such grace if they are particularly little. If you havent purchased a seat for your small child (which is legal up until the age of three) then dont expect to have them counted in the luggage count. No ticket, no luggage. Most people who are taking a long term trip out of the country, or a permanent trip out of the country, find this limit a little exasperating. However, from experience I can vouch for the frustration of arriving in a foreign country for the first time, negotiating language barriers and awkward gestures, while trying to lug around three hundred pounds of belongings packed carefully away in small and large luggage cases. Even with the help of carts on wheels (assuming the country you land in has them) eventually you have to talk over all of this material up a flight of steps or into a narrowed passageway. This can become a little more than merely discouraging. It can become downright risky. Again, the best thing to do if your luggage exceeds the international flight limit is ship everything that you can bear to part with in advance. Some nations take as long as 6 weeks to deliver your goods. If your trip is short, try merging. If you have to, purchase what you need to while youre there and then ship it back to your house. Youre not likely to end up waiting helplessly for your underwear from Australia or your pajama bottoms from Costa Rica.\n\nNo matter how up to date or up-to-the-minute you are regarding flight contracts, always check in with the airline business the day before you go. Policy changes dont always make it to the cyberspace in a reasonable length of time, and policy alterations regarding luggage and especially carry on material can change in a heart beat. Its always better to show up with the latest information than to believe your experience from even just a few months earlier will still ring true. Hindrance at the airport is simply twice as frustrating as the same feeling somewhere else. Its written into the literature that way."},{title:"San Diego Vacation Rental",body:"The city of southern California, san diego is locally known as ‘America’s Finest City’.

After all, Sport England has awarded Birmingham the title National City of Sport. Situated just west of the center of England, this sporting city offers a wide range of stag do activities for the bachelor party that’s looking for something a bit unique and a lot active.\n\nWhile no one is suggesting that you leave off the traditional naughty doings that have been a part of the pre-wedding festivities since early Greek times, these days the stag do is more often a full-bodied stag weekend with activities planned for day and night. A Birmingham stag do gives your party the chance to take in a day at the races, compete in races of your own, bust a gut laughing at some of the finest comedy in the UK, and then get up in the morning to head out for a full day of off-road karting, paintball tournaments, quad biking or whitewater rafting.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Birmingham stag do activity that will provide some unusual souvenirs for the lucky stag, how about an afternoon at the Birmingham greyhound track? In addition to giving him (and the rest of your lot) a chance to pad your pockets before a night out with the lovely strippers, you can name a race to commemorate his last hurrah. By making arrangements in advance through a UK tour operator, your stag do can boast its very own greyhound race, complete with private box and bar, race cards printed with the name of your race and a photo of the cup for your race being presented to the winnner.

While driving half asleep at 4.00 am, with a nagging doubt you have forgot something may be some holidaymaker’s idea of fun – for most it sounds like a bad way to start your holiday. However, help is at hand in the form of Airport Hotels, where you can spend a relaxed evening – and even afford an extra hour or two in bed before leaving.\n\nAirport hotels may not enjoy the best of reputations. In many peoples mind they are ranked alongside train station pubs – filled with chain smoking business men in cheap suits. However, while there is certainly a convincing argument to avoid train station pubs (you have to pay to get in the toilet for starters), airport hotels are a long way from their cheap and not-so-cheerful roots. These days the savvy traveller can pick up a great value deal at some excellent hotel accommodation situated close to their airport of departure.\n\nOne hotel that certainly fits this bill is the 4-star Arora International Hotel near Gatwick (http://www.gatwickairport.com). Situated a mere 8 minutes from the airport, the hotel boasts a health club, with state of the art facilities including a gym, jacuzzi, steam room and solarium. The quality of service and dining is also high with two bars, a deli and brassiere restaurant for those wishing to sample the culinary delights of this award winning hotel. For those using the hotel before they catch a flight there is every convenience with an Avis car rental desk within the hotel and an adjoining train station going directly to Gatwick.\n\nAnother big advantage of staying at airport hotels is many let you use their car park facilities – at often very reasonable rates. The Cottons Hotel and Spa situated near Manchester International Airport offers some excellent deals on up to 15 days parking for guests of their hotel. The hotel itself is also 4-star and comes equipped with pool, colour therapy sauna, steam room, gym, tennis courts and spa. While you may also be confused over what a colour therapy sauna is, you have to agree it sounds enticing and certainly beats crawling through Manchester traffic to catch an early morning flight.\n\nIf you really want to banish your negative image of airport hotels once and for all then you needn’t look much further than the completely re-vitalised Sheraton Skyline near Heathrow (http://www.heathrowairport.com). Visually stunning the Al Dente Ristorante is the ultimate experience of fine dining cuisine where Marco Di Tullio’s menus combine tradition, creativity and flavours based on perfect cooking techniques and obsessive research of the best market and imported products available in the UK. In the past airport hotels may have meant chicken in a basket – at the Skyline this type of dish is very much confined to memory. Overall, airport hotels have changed significantly over the past ten years and are no longer the realm of the odourly challenged. However, it is still recommended that the world of train station pubs is avoided unless on the look out for recreational drugs – or at the very least have a 50p coin to get into the toilet."},{title:"New Ideas For A Low Cost Vacation On Water",body:"If you really enjoy spending your vacation ‘on water’ or would like to try something new and exciting for the first time, then you can consider a houseboat vacation. There are so many fun things to do and so many great landscapes to see on a houseboat vacation! But before making further plans, let’s take a look at the options that you have for a low-cost vacation on water: you could rent a houseboat this year and try out an altogether exotic kind of vacation this year, or you could indulge in a houseboat timeshare. What is a houseboat timeshare? Most people who have used a houseboat timeshare say that it is a great way to spend your vacation at a very high-quality resort, in a place where you couldn’t get reservations so easily that too at a very low price! Doesn’t that sound great? But let’s see how and why houseboat timeshares can offer you with such fabulous opportunities of low-cost vacationing on water. \n\nInitially the concept of timeshare appeared somewhere in the 1960’s in France. The principle of a timeshare actually marketed the concept of ‘buying the hotel’ for vacationing. Indeed, timeshare is a form of real estate ownership, more precisely vacation property ownership. The owners divide the costs of running the resort and also the use of the place between themselves. This timeshare concept was first applied to land-resorts, but nowadays, we have all kinds of vacation properties, including houseboats. Houseboat timeshare works on a very simple principle. All 52 weeks of the year are divided between the owners (usually there are 51, considering that one week should remain for maintenance)! So they can own the resort on a 1/51 basis and can use the resort one week per year. Of course, one can buy as many houseboat timeshares as he/she wants to. But maybe you neither have the budget to do that nor the time. And spending your vacation in the same spot every year doesn’t seem to be such an exciting idea too! Therefore, several companies have been founded who promote the idea of exchanging timeshares. Thus being a timeshare owner helps you avail the opportunity to exchange the existing timeshare with someone else to a more pleasant vacation on a different spot for a very small fee. And so, with the houseboat timeshare you could spend less for a vacation that in other conditions would end up costing you quite a fortune.\n\nThere are many companies out there that deal in timeshare and exchanging. Several of them deal with all types of vacation property ownership, like land resorts, houseboat timesharing or even motor homes, yachts and campgrounds.\n\nIf you want to consider houseboat timeshares for a low-cost vacation on water but don’t know if you will really like the concept, then I would recommend that you go to one of the exchange companies and try to get a vacation timeshare for a week. These companies have special offers for non-timeshare-owners. In this way, you can check out what you’ll be ‘owning’ and see if it suits you or not. And of course, you can make a comparison between renting and houseboat timeshare when it comes to the question of your budget. In this way you’ll be able to assess if it is more convenient for you to rent or to pay the company’s fee and the maintenance fee for a houseboat timeshare. Whatever be your choice, don’t forget to enjoy your low-cost vacation on water to the fullest!"},{title:"Stu Unger Rise And Fall Of A Poker Genius",body:"Stu Unger is one of the biggest superstars to have immerged from the professional poker world. Besides being a true poker genius and a three time World Series of Poker champion, Stu Unger had a fascinating life story. It was not surprising that after his death Stu was the subject of a biography and a biopic. Stu Unger lived the life of a rock star including the quick rise to fame, the drugs, the comeback and the unavoidable death at an early age. Here you can read about the life story of the legendary poker player Stu Unger. The Beginning\n\nStuart Errol Ungar was born in 1953 to a Jewish family who lived in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. Stus father was a well known bookmaker and his mother was too ill to fight against her sons fascination with gambling. After the death of his father, 13 years old Stu had found a father figure at his neighbor Victor Romano, one of the infamous Genovese family soldiers. Stu and Romano had at least one thing in common: they both had an incredibly sharp memory, which was mainly used in poker and gin games. By that time, Stu was already an accomplished gin player who had gained vast experience in winning gin tournaments. Stu dropped out of school to become a full time gin rummy player. The Genovese family had benefited from Stus talent. In return, they provided him protection from other gamblers who found themselves offended by his harsh and arrogant playing style. \n\nThe Rise\n\nAs a professional gin player, Stu had managed to beat all the professional gin poker players around. According to the rumors, Stu caused Harry Yonkie Stein, one of the best players around to stop playing gin completely after beating him in a gin match. Since he was out of proper competition, Stu decided to focus on playing poker professionally. In 1976, he and his girlfriend relocated to Las Vegas where they got married and had a girl, Stephanie. In 1980, Stu won the World Series of Poker Main Event after beating experienced poker pros such as Doyle Bronson. Stu was the youngest WSOP champion in history and was nicknamed The Kid. Even though Stu won the 1981 WSOP Main Event, he still considered himself more a gin and rummy player than a poker player. After winning his first WSOP championship title, he was quoted saying that the poker world would meet better no limit players than him, but no one will ever be able to play gin rummy better than he does. At the same time, Stu had tried to use his skill to grab money at the blackjack table. Nevertheless, the casinos were not happy with Stus presence around the blackjack tables and he was constantly barred. In 1982, he was fined by the New Jersey Gaming Commission for cheating, although Stu has not done anything illegal but using his natural skill and phenomenal memory. The Fall\n\nIn 1990, Stu made another appearance to the WSOP. This time, he was heavily into drugs. He was a chip leader for the first three days of the event and then disappeared. He was found lying at his hotel room, unconscious from a drug overdose. However, it did not stop him from finishing ninth and earning enough money for his future cocaine supply. The Comeback\n\nAfter seven years of disappearing from the professional poker circle, Stu had returned to the WSOP. In 1997, he was broke, with damaged nostrils from cocaine abuse, addicted to horseracing and sports gambling, but still in shape to beat all the new contestants and gain back his WSOP Championship title. The local media was happy to embrace The Comeback Kid, but his success did not last long.\n\nThe Death\n\nStu Unger did not attend the 1998 World Series of Poker since he could not get the money to pay the entry fee. Seven months after Scotty Nguyen won the 1998 WSOP, Stu Ungar was found dead at his motel room in Las Vegas with 800 dollars in his pocket. Apparently, he died of a heart condition caused by years of drug abuse.

},{title:"Vacation Home Rental Success",body:"You love having a second home but the mortgage is putting a crater in your wallet. Many second home owners turn to renting their property as a vacation rental to help defray the costs of ownership. How do you price a vacation home rental without overcharging but making enough to cover your costs? Do your research.\n\nFind out what other owners of, similar sized homes in the area are charging. You can ask a local real estate agent for a price range, scan local papers or go online. There are also vacation rental sites like eVaca.com. These types of sites have advertisements from owners around the world and weekly rates for the properties are listed.\n\nThe time of year you rent out a property is important as well. If you want to rent out a ski lodge in Vermont, August is not going to be your “high time” of year, but January will. If you are going to rent the property in an “off” time of year you will not be able to charge as much as if you were renting the property in a peak time.\n\nYou also want to figure out what lengths you want to rent your property for. A Florida property in July near the beach will go for top dollar for a week. However, that same property in January you might only attract the snowbirds who want to rent at a lower price and rent it out on a monthly basis. You have to answer questions like, “do I want to mess around with weekend or nightly rentals” and “is it worth the hassle”.\n\nFigure out how many weeks you need to rent your property in order to make a profit or at least pay the bills. Say you need to make $12000 a year in rental income. If, after looking at other rentals, a rate of maybe $1,000 a week seems reasonable than you know you need to rent the property out for at least 12 weeks a year. But you might have to rent for a few more weeks at a lower rate to make up for “off peak” times of the year or if you do not get someone to fill every vacant period.\n\nMost important, do not forget to spend time in your own vacation home. Owning the property and not being able to enjoy it defeats the purpose of having that second home!"},{title:"Get Around Easily With A New York Limousine Service",body:"If you live in New York City or travel to and from New York City a lot, you know all about the traffic there. Getting places is often next to impossible, even with the gazillion yellow cabs. If you’re like me you often look with envy at those shiny limousines with their unformed drivers and wish you could sit in one. Well, you can. New York limo service is more affordable than you think, whether it’s for Newark airport transportation, LaGuardia airport transportation, or to drive wherever you wish to go.\n\nEvery time I hail a cab in New York City or wait for one at the airports, I hope I’ll be lucky enough to get one that’s halfway decent and that the driver actually speaks English. I have spent many anxious moments wondering if I ever get to my destination. Or whether I’d get ripped off. Even if all goes well, I can’t say I can remember many rides in New York cabs that were very pleasant. And given how much they cost by now, going with a limo makes ever more sense.\n\nThese days, using a New York limousine means you’re getting your choice of a variety of great luxury vehicles such as BMW, Mercedes Benz, Cadillac or Lincoln sedans or limos. Sedans usually seat three or four, standard stretch limos six to ten, and SUVs seven. Stretch SUVs like the eye-catching Stretch Hummer can seat up to 20. If style isn’t a priority, limo buses can be a comfortable alternative for up to 20 passengers. And if safety is a matter, you can even get armored New York limousines. Whether it’s JFK airport transportation or a night on the town, limos are the way to go.\n\nIf you haven’t been in a limo lately, you’ll be amazed at what you can get these days. Apart from comfort, safety, reliability, status and luxury, there are now limos with such things as giant flat-screen TVs, hardwood floors, more than six feet of headroom, and even fish tanks for that soothing touch. Check the websites of the leading New York limousine services to get detailed descriptions of the features and amenities of their fleet of impressive cars and limos.\n\nLimo service is all about luxury and feeling good about yourself. Being greeted by a uniformed limo driver at the airport is not only a great experience, it also means you’re getting to your destination faster and with much less stress. And you have a driver who is thoroughly professional, discreet, and who knows his way around. Ordering a limo for guests and business clients shows you appreciate and respect them. Having one for a graduation or prom can be an experience you never forget. Limo services also offer wedding limousine specials so that you have one less thing to worry about. And for a night on the town or going to a big game, what better way than to take a limo? What if you have an emergency and need to quickly go to a place where cabs won’t take you? A limo will. The best New York limousine services will drive you wherever you want within the continental United States.

Another reason why I love the casinos is how far they are from where I live so I can take my bike out in the morning have a good 3 hour drive to Atlantic City then at the end of the day I get to enjoy another 3 hours on my Harley, and if the weather is really bad I can either take my truck or just stay home and log on to one of the many online casinos available to choose from.\n\nI also enjoy watching an hour or 2 of television every night, some light sitcoms are a great way to lighten your minds load, and laughing out loud for 30 seconds every day is a great way to release stress.\n\nVideo games are also great for stress release, if you are mad at your boss what better way to get it out of you then boxing, just imagine you are pounding on your boss and hope you don’t lose.

It was at this time that Bryce made his immortal comment about Bryce Canyon – they called it “one hell of a place to lose a cow”.\n\nThe area remained basically undiscovered by European tourists, the first guest houses only being constructed around the time when the park was officially established.

When water runoff trickles across the rock, some areas erode rapidly whereas others hold firm. This variation in erosion speed causes the formation of pinnacles, or “hoodoos” of stable rock. In some places the water seeps down through cracks & eats out holes beneath the surface. When the side rock erodes away, an archway is left behind.

There are hundreds of hotels that are self-styled “boutique” places to stay, but not all of them fall into the traditional definition of boutique, which includes:      "},{title:"Business Travel With The Wife",body:"If you are an infrequent traveler you may need some tips to keep the wife happy while you are jet setting around the globe. Many individuals do not realize the tolls that traveling can have on married life. Occasionally your travels are going to take you to a location that your spouse would love to attend. You may be servicing customers near your or your wifes childhood homes, you may be visiting a destination that she has always desired to be at, she may simply want to spend some time with you.\n\nAfter you make the decision that the spouse will be going on the next business trip, you need to review your corporate travel policies. Many companies have fairly lax rules on spousal travel. However it could be possible that you have to pick up the differences in hotel room costs for the second person. Most companies however wave this fee if you are in good standings with them. So the accommodation’s are settled what is left to meet the wifes expectations well you will more than likely have to make some adjustments in your travel plans. Unless you work for a company that is far more progressive than any that I have seen before, you will be picking up the tab for your wifes travel. So start looking at sites such as http://www.travelblogger.info and reviewing the travel prices that they provide. By researching early you have the opportunity to cut some significant costs from your bill. This early research will also allow you to properly plan out your visits and time them with travel concerns. Always research all arrival locations for the cheapest airfare. A great example of this was my co-worker who was asked to go to Germany for some problem analysis. His spouse made the executive decision that she was going to also be going to Germany. After looking at tickets from the local airport to Frankfurt (typical landing point) he found the tickets to cost no less than $1395.00. He talked with me and I suggested he look at Berlin International Airport. The total for the ticket dropped to $611.00. Now he had to clear this change of plans with our boss because it increased his driving time on the ground by 1 hr. But the $600 + dollars that he saved on airfare travel more than made up for the increased car ride time. Speaking of the car. Make sure that the spouse is on the car rental agreement and insured. If your wife is like mine she is not going to be happy cooped up in a hotel while you are in facilities all day. She is going to want to get out and about during the day. Checking this minor point will save you loads of time and aggravation. The final item of concern is your dining tab. Be exceedingly careful and research your corporate policy closely on this one. Typically you will be allowed to pick-up the room breakfast on the corporate account for the wife. However it is highly unlikely that you will be able to expense out her lunch and dinner meals. As a matter of fact I have seen one gentlemen dismissed on this account. Now he had other issues, but this is the corporate policy that he broke that achieved the pink slip.\n\nSo in short you need to research where you are traveling too, you need to research when you are going to be traveling, and you need to look in depth at your corporate travel policies and don’t assume anything. Corporations have been in business for many years and most of the expense details are spelled out clearly in their guidelines. Where there is headway ask your supervisor and they should be able to inform you of exactly what will and will not be allowed to pass on your expense report."},{title:"Vacation Home Rental Success",body:"You love having a second home but the mortgage is putting a crater in your wallet. Many second home owners turn to renting their property as a vacation rental to help defray the costs of ownership. How do you price a vacation home rental without overcharging but making enough to cover your costs? Do your research.\n\nFind out what other owners of, similar sized homes in the area are charging. You can ask a local real estate agent for a price range, scan local papers or go online. There are also vacation rental sites like eVaca.com. These types of sites have advertisements from owners around the world and weekly rates for the properties are listed.\n\nThe time of year you rent out a property is important as well. If you want to rent out a ski lodge in Vermont, August is not going to be your “high time” of year, but January will. If you are going to rent the property in an “off” time of year you will not be able to charge as much as if you were renting the property in a peak time.\n\nYou also want to figure out what lengths you want to rent your property for. A Florida property in July near the beach will go for top dollar for a week. However, that same property in January you might only attract the snowbirds who want to rent at a lower price and rent it out on a monthly basis. You have to answer questions like, “do I want to mess around with weekend or nightly rentals” and “is it worth the hassle”.\n\nFigure out how many weeks you need to rent your property in order to make a profit or at least pay the bills. Say you need to make $12000 a year in rental income. If, after looking at other rentals, a rate of maybe $1,000 a week seems reasonable than you know you need to rent the property out for at least 12 weeks a year. But you might have to rent for a few more weeks at a lower rate to make up for “off peak” times of the year or if you do not get someone to fill every vacant period.\n\nMost important, do not forget to spend time in your own vacation home. Owning the property and not being able to enjoy it defeats the purpose of having that second home!"},{title:"Get Around Easily With A New York Limousine Service",body:"If you live in New York City or travel to and from New York City a lot, you know all about the traffic there.

The area is a favorite destination among those seeking an adventurous vacation. Copper Canyon is one of the six gorges in the area. Although the name suggests that the gorge might have some relevance to copper mining, this is not the case. The name is derived from the copper and green lichen covering the canyon. Copper Canyon has two climatic zones. The region features an alpine climate at the top and a subtropical climate at the lower levels. Winters are cold with frequent snowstorms at the higher altitudes. Summers are dry and hot. The capital city, Chihuahua, is a high altitude desert where weather ranges from cold winters to hot summers. The region is unique because of the various ecosystems that exist within it.\n\nAnother unique feature of Copper Canyon is the presence of the Tarahumara Indian culture. These semi-nomadic people live in cave dwellings. Their livelihood chiefly depends on farming and cattle ranching. Apart from the native population, the local wildlife is also a major crowd puller. Several migratory and native birds, mammals and reptiles call Copper Canyon their home. The exquisite fauna in this near-pristine land is also worth checking out. A traveler may choose to explore the area by hiking around the canyon or venturing into it. Detailed planning is required for those who wish to venture into the depths of the canyon. There are a number of travel companies that specialize in organizing tours to the region. Visitors can fly to Copper Canyon using a tourist visa, which is valid for 180 days.

There is nothing quite as bad as spending a great day of vacation only to come back to a less-than-great place to stay for the night. Anytime you are away from home it is important to choose the best accommodations for your comfort and enjoyment. It doesn’t matter if you are going on a three week trip to Europe of if you are going to a weekend wedding celebration, choosing accommodations should be on the top of your list no matter what.\n\nOne of the most important things to remember when you begin to search for accommodations is yourself. Knowing your interests, preferences, and the things that are most important to you in any place you stay is necessary in choosing the right accommodations. For example, you should know whether you prefer an all-inclusive type luxury hotel or a quiet cabin that is off the beaten path. Know the things that will make a trip amazing or horrible for you and then don’t settle for accommodations that are different than what you want.\n\nYour budget is another thing to consider when you’re looking for great accommodations for any event. Sure, you might love to stay in the nicest five-star hotel a city offers, but if your budget calls for something a little more modest then it is best to agree with your budget. Keep in mind, however, that your budget should look different based on how important the event or trip is to you. Your honeymoon, for example, should be a higher priority than the accommodations for your next business trip or even for the wedding of a friend. Don’t be afraid to alter your budget for accommodations from trip to trip, just don’t expect for each getaway to be as nice as the rest.\n\nYour personal taste and style can help you determine what is the best accommodations for you in any situation. Go for a place that offers the ammenities that you desire and that feels comfortable and relaxing to you. If having a jaccuzi tub is important to you, then look for accommodations that offer them at no extra charge.\n\nThe important thing in any travel situation is to stay somewhere that is restful, relaxing, and peaceful. So whatever it takes for you to be at peace, find accommodations that match your needs. You will enjoy any event, holiday or vacation more if you’re stayin in a great place."

Such an indulgence can make a vacation a truly rejuvenating experience. One of the best ways to get the luxury of the rich and famous to fit into your budget can be yours through yacht charter companies. These companies specialize in creating custom sailing vacations that redefine travel. \n\nPlanning Your Luxury Trip \n\nWith your budget in mind, it is easy to plan a chartered yacht vacation. Companies often have a fleet of sailing vessels that can accommodate parties of various sizes. You may want to make it a more intimate trip with only close family. There are charters that can be rented for as few as two people. These include either a sailboat or motorboat and can come with or without a crew and captain to sail the ship for you. If you choose not to hire a crew, you will have to show that you are knowledgeable of sailing and can handle the ship competently.\n\nThe next part of planning is to determine your starting and ending ports. This could be a place close to home and sail in one area or start and finish at two different ports. Generally, starting and stopping in the same port will save you money and is usually more convenient. You can also fly to a destination far from home and then sail another exotic sea. There are luxury yacht charter companies that cruise the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas or around Alaska, the Panama Canal, or anyplace you can imagine.\n\nDetermining the type of cruise is another aspect of planning a chartered yachting trip. You can have as little or many crew members as the ship will hold. A captain takes all the worries out of navigating and onboard housekeeping services make it a real vacation that rivals the finest hotel services. You can also choose to have a chef and service crew as part of your vacation package.\n\nIf you like the idea of knowing what it is really like to sail, but don’t want to risk safety, you can charter a sailing cruise that puts you in the role of deck hand. A competent crew will direct you as to your “chores” for keeping the ship in top shape and on course. \n\nDestinations & Ports of important Charter Companies  One of the greatest benefits of choosing a chartered cruise as a vacation is the choice. You will most likely have a rough itinerary and that can be affected by weather. However, you are flexible in deciding how long you want to stay in a particular port and if you want to add or subtract stops along the way.\n\nYour yacht is your hotel that travels with you. There is only one flight and one hotel to book! Then you take all of your luggage and unpack it just once to enjoy several days of new destinations.\n\nIf you have never experienced cruising before, a chartered experience is a great way to get your feet wet. It is different from cruise lines with thousands of guests because the people on your ship will be your friends and family. The personal touches of a chartered trip will help you develop your love for the sea with all the best benefits of commercial cruises."},{title:"Tremblant In Canada",body:"Tremblant is based in Canada and has over 90 runs servicing millions of skiers each year.

With its longest run being 6km long, you cannot help but picture Tremblant as the skiing capital of Canada. Tremblant has also recently had 18 acres of quality, freestyle snowboarding playground custom built. With jumps, rails, ramps and half-pipes those who are familiar with this should be sure to check it out should the visit. With 94 slaloms, the Tremblant management team have been sure to cater for all levels with 31 intermediate slopes, 17 slopes for novices and mountains worth of expert, countered terrain. Standing 870 metres tall, and with snowboarding and skiing facilities on all four faces, it is no wonder the 628 acre facility is considered the home to Skiing in the area. The facility allows for natural snow between November and April however this does not set anyone back for the other months of the year. The revolutionary Avalanche system actually turns water into snow in an instant. So how does the system work? In Tremblant there are 885 guns, that spray a cooling gassy chemical onto the snow and the coverage is able to not only turn water into snow in minutes, but also maintain organic snow forever. The amazing system ensures that the temperature is just right: not turning the snow to ice. The revolutionary system is also used to alter the temperature of snow for big events, however its main advantage is 365 day snow, for the people of Tremblant.

Whilst most holiday makers will experience the Tremblant as experienced skiers, there are also many options available to the beginners and intermediates choosing to visit Tremblant. With over 40 beginner slopes and over 50 multi-lingual skiing instructors you really have to visit Tremblant to understand its sheer scale. Learning to ski in Tremblant is not only a great idea because of the experience of the instructors, but also because your choices are not restricted at all. During my first visit to Tremblant I was a keen skier but I had never had the opportunity to snowboard before. During my time in Tremblant I was taught how to snowboard in one day, and by the end of the vacation I was able to attempt challenging runs on the intermediate circuits. Although my experience in skiing was helpful, I felt a lot of this came down to the dexterity of the instructors. The accommodation in Tremblant is amazing, with 6 hotels all with excellent service and offering amazing luxury to their guests. In a hotel, where you see amazing views onto the massive mountain, you also see firework displays that they put on for the tourists each evening. In case that puts you off, I was assured the fireworks do not make any noise, apart from at the weekends. The amazing Tremblant skiing resort has never hosted a large event, and is firmly known for its ability to cater for tourists, however that has not stopped it, in its quest to host the 2009 open. Having placed a bid, we can all wait and see if Tremblant is successful. Ski Press Weekly voted Tremlant the best skiing facility for tourists in North America and this is hardly a surprise. With accessible pricing, a massive selection of runs and a lift that can carry over 25,000 people an hour it is hardly surprising."},{title:"Family Safari Vacation To The Home Of The Gods",body:"Families traveling with kids will find Amboseli national park a safari destination matched to no other, with less tourist traffic, breathtaking open spaces, easy access from Nairobi, the list is endless.\n\nThe park described by writers as ‘ a home for the Gods’ covers 150sq mile south of Nairobi and lies just at the foot of Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest mountain at 5,895m.

Copper Canyon has two climatic zones. The region features an alpine climate at the top and a subtropical climate at the lower levels. Winters are cold with frequent snowstorms at the higher altitudes. Summers are dry and hot.

These semi-nomadic people live in cave dwellings. Their livelihood chiefly depends on farming and cattle ranching. Apart from the native population, the local wildlife is also a major crowd puller. Several migratory and native birds, mammals and reptiles call Copper Canyon their home. The exquisite fauna in this near-pristine land is also worth checking out. A traveler may choose to explore the area by hiking around the canyon or venturing into it. Detailed planning is required for those who wish to venture into the depths of the canyon.

There is nothing quite as bad as spending a great day of vacation only to come back to a less-than-great place to stay for the night. Anytime you are away from home it is important to choose the best accommodations for your comfort and enjoyment. It doesn’t matter if you are going on a three week trip to Europe of if you are going to a weekend wedding celebration, choosing accommodations should be on the top of your list no matter what.\n\nOne of the most important things to remember when you begin to search for accommodations is yourself. Knowing your interests, preferences, and the things that are most important to you in any place you stay is necessary in choosing the right accommodations. For example, you should know whether you prefer an all-inclusive type luxury hotel or a quiet cabin that is off the beaten path. Know the things that will make a trip amazing or horrible for you and then don’t settle for accommodations that are different than what you want.\n\nYour budget is another thing to consider when you’re looking for great accommodations for any event. Sure, you might love to stay in the nicest five-star hotel a city offers, but if your budget calls for something a little more modest then it is best to agree with your budget. Keep in mind, however, that your budget should look different based on how important the event or trip is to you. Your honeymoon, for example, should be a higher priority than the accommodations for your next business trip or even for the wedding of a friend. Don’t be afraid to alter your budget for accommodations from trip to trip, just don’t expect for each getaway to be as nice as the rest.\n\nYour personal taste and style can help you determine what is the best accommodations for you in any situation. Go for a place that offers the ammenities that you desire and that feels comfortable and relaxing to you. If having a jaccuzi tub is important to you, then look for accommodations that offer them at no extra charge.\n\nThe important thing in any travel situation is to stay somewhere that is restful, relaxing, and peaceful.

Such an indulgence can make a vacation a truly rejuvenating experience. One of the best ways to get the luxury of the rich and famous to fit into your budget can be yours through yacht charter companies. These companies specialize in creating custom sailing vacations that redefine travel. \n\nPlanning Your Luxury Trip \n\nWith your budget in mind, it is easy to plan a chartered yacht vacation. Companies often have a fleet of sailing vessels that can accommodate parties of various sizes. You may want to make it a more intimate trip with only close family. There are charters that can be rented for as few as two people. These include either a sailboat or motorboat and can come with or without a crew and captain to sail the ship for you. If you choose not to hire a crew, you will have to show that you are knowledgeable of sailing and can handle the ship competently.\n\nThe next part of planning is to determine your starting and ending ports. This could be a place close to home and sail in one area or start and finish at two different ports. Generally, starting and stopping in the same port will save you money and is usually more convenient. You can also fly to a destination far from home and then sail another exotic sea. There are luxury yacht charter companies that cruise the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas or around Alaska, the Panama Canal, or anyplace you can imagine.\n\nDetermining the type of cruise is another aspect of planning a chartered yachting trip. You can have as little or many crew members as the ship will hold. A captain takes all the worries out of navigating and onboard housekeeping services make it a real vacation that rivals the finest hotel services. You can also choose to have a chef and service crew as part of your vacation package.\n\nIf you like the idea of knowing what it is really like to sail, but don’t want to risk safety, you can charter a sailing cruise that puts you in the role of deck hand. A competent crew will direct you as to your “chores” for keeping the ship in top shape and on course. \n\nDestinations & Ports of important Charter Companies  One of the greatest benefits of choosing a chartered cruise as a vacation is the choice. You will most likely have a rough itinerary and that can be affected by weather. However, you are flexible in deciding how long you want to stay in a particular port and if you want to add or subtract stops along the way.\n\nYour yacht is your hotel that travels with you. There is only one flight and one hotel to book! Then you take all of your luggage and unpack it just once to enjoy several days of new destinations.\n\nIf you have never experienced cruising before, a chartered experience is a great way to get your feet wet. It is different from cruise lines with thousands of guests because the people on your ship will be your friends and family. The personal touches of a chartered trip will help you develop your love for the sea with all the best benefits of commercial cruises."},{title:"Tremblant In Canada",body:"Tremblant is based in Canada and has over 90 runs servicing millions of skiers each year.

With its longest run being 6km long, you cannot help but picture Tremblant as the skiing capital of Canada. Tremblant has also recently had 18 acres of quality, freestyle snowboarding playground custom built. With jumps, rails, ramps and half-pipes those who are familiar with this should be sure to check it out should the visit. With 94 slaloms, the Tremblant management team have been sure to cater for all levels with 31 intermediate slopes, 17 slopes for novices and mountains worth of expert, countered terrain. Standing 870 metres tall, and with snowboarding and skiing facilities on all four faces, it is no wonder the 628 acre facility is considered the home to Skiing in the area. The facility allows for natural snow between November and April however this does not set anyone back for the other months of the year. The revolutionary Avalanche system actually turns water into snow in an instant. So how does the system work? In Tremblant there are 885 guns, that spray a cooling gassy chemical onto the snow and the coverage is able to not only turn water into snow in minutes, but also maintain organic snow forever. The amazing system ensures that the temperature is just right: not turning the snow to ice. The revolutionary system is also used to alter the temperature of snow for big events, however its main advantage is 365 day snow, for the people of Tremblant. The Tremblant Lift system can carry over 27,000 snowboarders and skiers per hour, whilst the Gondola and quads also aid the in the massive effort of lifting millions of people up the mountain each day. For those of you who get hungry there are also great accessible eateries available at the top of the 870 metre mountain. Whilst most holiday makers will experience the Tremblant as experienced skiers, there are also many options available to the beginners and intermediates choosing to visit Tremblant. With over 40 beginner slopes and over 50 multi-lingual skiing instructors you really have to visit Tremblant to understand its sheer scale. Learning to ski in Tremblant is not only a great idea because of the experience of the instructors, but also because your choices are not restricted at all. During my first visit to Tremblant I was a keen skier but I had never had the opportunity to snowboard before. During my time in Tremblant I was taught how to snowboard in one day, and by the end of the vacation I was able to attempt challenging runs on the intermediate circuits. Although my experience in skiing was helpful, I felt a lot of this came down to the dexterity of the instructors. The accommodation in Tremblant is amazing, with 6 hotels all with excellent service and offering amazing luxury to their guests. In a hotel, where you see amazing views onto the massive mountain, you also see firework displays that they put on for the tourists each evening. In case that puts you off, I was assured the fireworks do not make any noise, apart from at the weekends. The amazing Tremblant skiing resort has never hosted a large event, and is firmly known for its ability to cater for tourists, however that has not stopped it, in its quest to host the 2009 open. Having placed a bid, we can all wait and see if Tremblant is successful. Ski Press Weekly voted Tremlant the best skiing facility for tourists in North America and this is hardly a surprise. With accessible pricing, a massive selection of runs and a lift that can carry over 25,000 people an hour it is hardly surprising."},{title:"Train Travel On Track For Safety",body:"To keep you on the road to safety, here are a few basic tips for motorists at rail crossings:\n\n• Expect a train at any time. Trains can run anytime of day or night, on any track, in any direction.\n\n• Don’t be fooled. The train is closer and faster than you think. It’s easy to misjudge a train’s speed and its distance, especially at night. If you see a train, just wait.\n\n• Trains can’t stop quickly or swerve; be prepared to yield. After fully applying the brakes, a loaded freight train traveling at 55 miles per hour takes a mile or more to stop.\n\n• Stop and wait when gates are down or lights are flashing. Only continue across after the gates go up and red lights stop flashing. Remember, too, that when on foot, you should stay off railroad cars and tracks. It’s illegal and too often it’s deadly.\n\nThese tips come from the safety experts at Voith Turbo, York, Pa., which manufactures a device that helps trains with braking, to make train travel even better. The new type of railcar is on track to save Americans time, trouble and maybe even their lives. These trains can go from stations in the suburbs to stations in the city without switching locomotives. Such flexible trains, called DMUs–or Diesel Multiple Units -were designed so commuters in the suburbs would not have to switch to locomotives that work only on city rails. According to Colorado Railcar Manufacturing, the company that designed the cars, the DMU combines its drive systems and passenger accommodations into a single unit-each DMU has seating for 90 passengers and can pull additional motorized coaches."},{title:"How To Play Texas Holdem For Beginners",body:"Texas Holdem is by far the most common for of poker played today due to is popularity there are even several TV shows of the game.

Any player may use any of these cards to make the best 5 card hand possible, but you are not allowed to actually touch the cards, each player can use the same cards if it help them, this is why your hole cards are so important.\n\n5. As with the pre-flop there is now another round of betting, it is at this point you will start to see players folding.\n\n6. After the betting is over, the dealer will burn another card, then deal the fourth of the communal cards. This card is called the Turn card\n\n7. Again another round of betting begins and now is when you will start to see the size of the pot really grow.\n\n8. One last time the dealer burns the top card before turning over the last card of the game, called the River card. Players now have all 5 of the communal cards and their own hole card to make the best 5 card hand.\n\n9. One last chance is given to raise the bets or get out of the game. After this each player still in the game will show their cards. This is called the Showdown. The player with the best hand is declared the winner and wins the pot.\n\nNow that you know the basic order of the game you are ready to start playing Texas Holdem. Holdem is a simple game to learn but if hard to master. This is the part that will take you many hand and many dollars, but if you put in the time you will be rewarded for it."},{title:"Choosing A Static Caravan",body:"When choosing a static caravan you will probably look for the holiday park which meets your requirements and then move onto the caravan. Selecting the right holiday park is vital to ensure a long term ownership.\n\nNow for the caravan and looking for the right caravan to suit your needs. Most of the Parks will deal with majority of the manufacturers. If buying directly from the park you will probably deal with a salesperson instead of direct with the manufacturers. You can collect brochures direct from the manufacturers to research all the models and specifications which will not only ensure you choose the correct model but also help you to understand what to look for and choice of different models. To see the caravan you can visit them at key caravan exhibitions as most top manufacturers will display there, see events.\n\nThe static holiday caravan has been designed for holiday use instead of full time living. With its modern construction and use of high quality materials the static caravan should be built to British and European standard: BS EN 1647 but some luxury caravans are built to BS 3632 confirming to residential standards.\n\nNormal static caravan can come in either one or two sections with width up to 22ft and 60ft long. If you have a one piece model this is a single unit and the two piece is known as a twin and usually assembled on site.\n\nDecide on how many bedrooms you require as most caravans can be from 2 to 4 bedrooms but up to eight berths. Manufactures will normally have their own layout but will offer a number of ranges depending on your budget.\n\nWhen it comes to size and specifications you should not only look at all of your own needs but if you are sub letting then there maybe other requirements. This decision should be looked at before purchase, maybe make a list of what you need and what is needed for sub letting.\n\nBudget will normally make your decision also how often you use the caravan and again if you going to sublet. If you will be there for long periods of time then it may be worth spending a little extra to gain more living space or an extra bedroom but if only there for short periods and subletting you may opt for the standard size and specifications hopefully providing you with a better return."},{title:"What Makes A Hotel Boutique",body:"The term “boutique hotel” has been widely used in recent years, but what does it mean and why should you stay in one?\n\nThere are lots of companies that claim to specialise in boutique hotels. For many, a boutique hotel is simply one that’s not part of a national or international chain and that distinguishes itself by its design, location or additional features. Many hotels aspire to be a boutique hotel without actually achieving it. Overall, there are four main elements to the true boutique hotel:\n\nSize\n\nLarge hotels can be cool, trendy and chic, but they can’t be boutique. Just as the word is used to describe small, design-led specialist shops, so it applies to hotels. Hotels that apply the term “boutique” to themselves or have it ascribed to them are usually small – certainly less than 50 rooms and in some cases with only one or two. Their size contributes to the atmosphere and service that characterises a hotel with a difference. Whilst size might count in terms of the number of rooms, it doesn’t follow that those rooms must also be small. In fact, a hotel than could easily accommodate 20 rooms might choose instead to create just ten, but make them spacious and luxurious, catering to the boutique market.\n\nDesign\n\nWhen the first boutique hotel was opened in New York in 1984, by hotel entrepreneurs Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell, it was praised for its original design and quirky nature. Designed for those who really wanted to participate in their travel rather than passively take it all in, Morgans, and those that followed it, challenged the way we thought about hotels. Although Schrager would not now describe his hotels as boutique, the name has been applied to those hotel who followed in his footsteps as far as design is concerned. From clean and contemporary to themed rooms and classic elegance, a boutique hotel must have a clear design theme and attention to detail.\n\nService\n\nThe hallmark of an excellent boutique hotel is its service. Whether the hotel chooses to assign a personal butler to each guest, or just hires and trains staff to anticipate your every need, the service at a boutique hotel is really what it should be at any hotel: ensuring that your stay goes without a hitch, that you can get transport, opera tickets or excellent meals when you want them and making you feel at home rather than feeling like you’re a nuisance. Boutique hotels are scattered all over the world, from 24-hour cities like New York, London and Rio De Janeiro to island havens in the Indian or Pacific Oceans. What often sets them apart are the buildings that contain them. From former plantation houses to old textile mills, towers and palazzos, the type of building often forms the basis of the design and it is the blend of architecture, design and service that turns what could be just another hotel into a boutique one."},{title:"Lost In Lagos Portugal",body:"Lagos is a small town in Portugal built on a large hill overlooking the Mediterranean Ocean. While its old world charm is evident during the day, it can be a real pain at night. Upon arriving by train in Lagos, I quickly booked a bed in a private home with a local family. I was loaded in a car and driven to the home that was just over the crest of the hill on which Lagos is built. From the home, it was about a mile down to the beaches and water. Ah, good old exercise. Being from San Diego, I immediately put on my trunks, flip flops and headed for a swim. As I came over the top of the hill, I looked around to get my bearing and admire the view of the sleepy town of Lagos. It reminded me of home and I stomped on down to the water with a smile on my face. While swimming and catching a tan [okay, sunburn], I met some fellow travelers from London. From the beach, they took me to see cultural sites such as museums and so on. Okay, we went to a couple of bars. As evening turned into night, I endeavored to turn in early as I was burnt out from the long train ride from Lisbon. We agreed to meet the next day and I congratulated myself on my restraint as I walked out of the drinking establishment. As I walked along, it dawned on me that I didn’t know the name of the street I lived on. No reason for alarm. I was at the bottom of the hill and a mile or so up on the top was my room. Figuring I would see something familiar, I started huffing it up the hill. Many of us non-Europeans go to Europe for the historic effect. Tiny winding streets with cobblestones are a personal favorite, but not when you’re wearing flip flops and there is practically no lighting. I fell on my butt at least twice on dew covered cobblestones. As I neared the top of the hill, I managed to crack my right foot on one of those owe so cute half curbs that seem to appear throughout Europe. Making matters worse, I was lost. I stopped to get my bearings and tried to avoid thinking about the sticky, wet feeling on my right flip flop. It was useless. There wasn’t enough light to make out much and what I could see was completely unfamiliar. There were people walking around, but I couldn’t ask them for help since I had been to stupid to write down the address of my host. Being a typical male, I took the only logical option available to me. I walked up and down streets for roughly two hours, got chased by two dogs, cracked my right foot AGAIN on curb and generally developed a bad mood. Just as I was contemplating sleeping in the bushes, I rounded the corner and there it was. The most beautiful little white house with a $6 room in Lagos. Delusional and tired, I staggered up to the door. It was locked. I gathered my wits and knocked. The lady of the house opened the door, looked me up and down and started giggling. Like a wayward son, she took me into the kitchen and made some tea. I had scrapes on my knees and the toenail on the big toes of my right foot was an international disaster zone. She and her husband kept asking me if I had been in a fight!\n\nLagos is a great town if you’re looking for a little beach time. Just make absolutely sure you write down the address of where you are staying."}]},function(e,t){e.exports=[{title:"The Science Of Superstitions",body:"“The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.” Albert Einstein, The World as I See It, 1931 The debate between realism and anti-realism is, at least, a century old. Does Science describe the real world – or are its theories true only within a certain conceptual framework? Is science only instrumental or empirically adequate or is there more to it than that?\n\nThe current – mythological – image of scientific enquiry is as follows:\n\nWithout resorting to reality, one can, given infinite time and resources, produce all conceivable theories. One of these theories is bound to be the “truth”. To decide among them, scientists conduct experiments and compare their results to predictions yielded by the theories. A theory is falsified when one or more of its predictions fails. No amount of positive results – i.e., outcomes that confirm the theory’s predictions – can “prove right” a theory. Theories can only be proven false by that great arbiter, reality.\n\nJose Ortega y Gasset said (in an unrelated exchange) that all ideas stem from pre-rational beliefs. William James concurred by saying that accepting a truth often requires an act of will which goes beyond facts and into the realm of feelings. Maybe so, but there is little doubt today that beliefs are somehow involved in the formation of many scientific ideas, if not of the very endeavor of Science. After all, Science is a human activity and humans always believe that things exist (=are true) or could be true.\n\nA distinction is traditionally made between believing in something’s existence, truth, value of appropriateness (this is the way that it ought to be) – and believing that something. The latter is a propositional attitude: we think that something, we wish that something, we feel that something and we believe that something. Believing in A and believing that A – are different.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that belief is a limited affair. Few of us would tend to believe in contradictions and falsehoods. Catholic theologians talk about explicit belief (in something which is known to the believer to be true) versus implicit one (in the known consequences of something whose truth cannot be known). Truly, we believe in the probability of something (we, thus, express an opinion) – or in its certain existence (truth).\n\nAll humans believe in the existence of connections or relationships between things. This is not something which can be proven or proven false (to use Popper’s test). That things consistently follow each other does not prove they are related in any objective, “real”, manner – except in our minds. This belief in some order (if we define order as permanent relations between separate physical or abstract entities) permeates both Science and Superstition. They both believe that there must be – and is – a connection between things out there.\n\nScience limits itself and believes that only certain entities inter-relate within well defined conceptual frames (called theories). Not everything has the potential to connect to everything else. Entities are discriminated, differentiated, classified and assimilated in worldviews in accordance with the types of connections that they forge with each other.\n\nMoreover, Science believes that it has a set of very effective tools to diagnose, distinguish, observe and describe these relationships. It proves its point by issuing highly accurate predictions based on the relationships discerned through the use of said tools. Science (mostly) claims that these connections are “true” in the sense that they are certain – not probable.\n\nThe cycle of formulation, prediction and falsification (or proof) is the core of the human scientific activity. Alleged connections that cannot be captured in these nets of reasoning are cast out either as “hypothetical” or as “false”. In other words: Science defines “relations between entities” as “relations between entities which have been established and tested using the scientific apparatus and arsenal of tools”. This, admittedly, is a very cyclical argument, as close to tautology as it gets.\n\nSuperstition is a much simpler matter: everything is connected to everything in ways unbeknown to us. We can only witness the results of these subterranean currents and deduce the existence of such currents from the observable flotsam. The planets influence our lives, dry coffee sediments contain information about the future, black cats portend disasters, certain dates are propitious, certain numbers are to be avoided. The world is unsafe because it can never be fathomed. But the fact that we – limited as we are – cannot learn about a hidden connection – should not imply that it does not exist.\n\nScience believes in two categories of relationships between entities (physical and abstract alike). The one is the category of direct links – the other that of links through a third entity. In the first case, A and B are seen to be directly related. In the second case, there is no apparent link between A and B, but a third entity, C could well provide such a connection (for instance, if A and B are parts of C or are separately, but concurrently somehow influenced by it).\n\nEach of these two categories is divided to three subcategories: causal relationships, functional relationships and correlative relationship.\n\nA and B will be said to be causally related if A precedes B, B never occurs if A does not precede it and always occurs after A occurs. To the discerning eye, this would seem to be a relationship of correlation (“whenever A happens B happens”) and this is true. Causation is subsumed by a the 1.0 correlation relationship category. In other words: it is a private case of the more general case of correlation.\n\nA and B are functionally related if B can be predicted by assuming A but we have no way of establishing the truth value of A. The latter is a postulate or axiom.

Astrology is defined as ‘the art or practice of determining the supposed influences of the planets and their motions on human affairs and human disposition’. From this practice a horoscope can be produced – a diagram (or chart) of the relative positions of planets and signs of the Zodiac at a specific time, usually the time of birth. A forecast can then be produced.\n\nThe Zodiac:\n\nWestern Astrology originated way back, around 500 BC, with a concept called the Zodiac being developed. This comprised of an imaginary sphere surrounding the earth, which followed the path of the Sun through the constellations during the year. The Zodiac was split into twelve sections, each named after the specific constellation noted in that area.  Elements: Many ancient philosophies used a set of classical elements to explain the way nature behaved. Each sign was connected to one of the classical elements (fire, earth, air, or water) and was also related to a region of focus; social, personal or universal.\n\n* Water signs are related to growth processes, identification and emotion. In tandem with the other elements, water feels that fire will make it boil, air will evaporate it, but earth will shape and channel it.\n\n* Fire signs are related to action, passion, and energy. In tandem with the other elements, fire feels that earth will smother it, water will drown it, but air will fan and enliven it.\n\n* Air signs are related to thought, perspective and communication. In tandem with the other elements, air feels that water will obscure it, earth will suffocate it, but fire will inspire and uplift it.\n\n* Earth signs are related to sensation, stability, and practicality. In tandem with the other elements, earth feels that air will dry it, fire will dry it, but water will refresh and nourish it.\n\nModalities:\n\nEach sign is connected to one of three modalities; cardinal (sometimes referred to as movable), fixed, and mutable.\n\nThere are four quadrants following the order of the zodiacal signs, with three signs in each. Each quadrant describes a season, beginning with a cardinal sign, continuing to a fixed sign, and ending with a mutable sign.\n\nModalities and Related Zodiac Signs:\n\n* Mutable signs are related to adaptability, resourcefulness and holism. They are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces.\n\n* Fixed signs are related to determination, focus and individuality. They are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius.\n\n* Cardinal signs are related to creativity and initiation. They are Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn.\n\nSummary of Zodiac Sign Characteristics:\n\n* Aries (cardinal, fire, personal): defensive, energetic, head down, assertive, impulsive.\n\n* Taurus (fixed, earth, personal): patient, indulgent, resourceful, thorough, devoted. * Gemini (mutable, air, personal): quick, logical, inquisitive.\n\n* Cancer (cardinal, water, personal): clinging, protective, sensitive. * Leo (fixed, fire, social): theatrical, generous, proud. * Virgo (mutable, earth, social): critically, practical, efficient.\n\n* Libra (cardinal, air, social): lazy, co-operative, fair. * Scorpio (fixed, water, social): anxious, passionate, sensitive.\n\n* Sagittarius (mutable, fire, universal): careless, free, straightforward. * Capricorn (cardinal, earth, universal): suspicious, prudent, cautious. * Aquarius (fixed, air, universal): detached, democratic, unconventional. * Pisces (mutable, water, universal): distracted, imaginative, sensitive."
},{title:"Althusser Competing Interpellations And The Third Text",body:"With the exception of Nietzsche, no other madman has contributed so much to human sanity as has Louis Althusser. He is mentioned twice in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. There could be no greater lapse: for two important decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at the eye of all the important cultural storms. He fathered quite a few of them.\n\nThis newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize his work before suggesting a few (minor) modifications to it.\n\n(1) Society consists of practices: economic, political and ideological.\n\nAlthusser defines a practice as:\n\n“Any process of transformation of a determinate product, affected\n\nby a determinate human labour, using determinate means (of production)”\n\nThe economic practice (the historically specific mode of production) transforms raw materials to finished products using human labour and other means of production, all organized within defined webs of inter-relations. The political practice does the same with social relations as the raw materials. Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way that a subject relates to his real life conditions of existence.\n\nThis is a rejection of the mechanistic worldview (replete with bases and superstructures). It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology. It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”. It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.\n\nIn it, the very existence and reproduction of the social base (not merely its expression) is dependent upon the social superstructure. The superstructure is “relatively autonomous” and ideology has a central part in it – see entry about Marx and Engels and entry concerning Hegel.\n\nThe economic structure is determinant but another structure could be dominant, depending on the historical conjuncture. Determination (now called over-determination – see Note) specifies the form of economic production upon which the dominant practice depends. Put otherwise: the economic is determinant not because the practices of the social formation (political and ideological) are the social formation’s expressive epiphenomena – but because it determines WHICH of them is dominant.\n\n(2) People relate to the conditions of existence through the practice of ideology. Contradictions are smoothed over and (real) problems are offered false (though seemingly true) solutions. Thus, ideology has a realistic dimension – and a dimension of representations (myths, concepts, ideas, images). There is (harsh, conflicting) reality – and the way that we represent it both to ourselves and to others.\n\n(3) To achieve the above, ideology must not be seen to err or, worse, remain speechless. It, therefore, confronts and poses (to itself) only answerable questions. This way, it remains confined to a fabulous, legendary, contradiction-free domain. It ignores other questions altogether.\n\n(4) Althusser introduced the concept of “The Problematic”:\n\n“The objective internal reference … the system of questions\n\ncommanding the answers given”\n\nIt determines which problems, questions and answers are part of the game – and which should be blacklisted and never as much as mentioned. It is a structure of theory (ideology), a framework and the repertoire of discourses which – ultimately – yield a text or a practice. All the rest is excluded.\n\nIt, therefore, becomes clear that what is omitted is of no less importance than what is included in a text. The problematic of a text relates to its historical context (“moment”) by incorporating both: inclusions as well as omissions, presences as much as absences. The problematic of the text fosters the generation of answers to posed questions – and of defective answers to excluded questions.\n\n(5) The task of “scientific” (e.g., Marxist) discourse, of Althusserian critical practice is to deconstruct the problematic, to read through ideology and evidence the real conditions of existence. This is a “symptomatic reading” of TWO TEXTS:\n\n“It divulges the undivulged event in the text that it reads and, in the\n\nsame movement, relates to it a different text, present, as a necessary\n\nabsence, in the first … (Marx’s reading of Adam Smith) presupposes\n\nthe existence of two texts and the measurement of the first against\n\nthe second. But what distinguishes this new reading from the old,\n\nis the fact that in the new one, the second text is articulated with the\n\nlapses in the first text … (Marx measures) the problematic contained\n\nin the paradox of an answer which does not correspond to any questions posed.”\n\nAlthusser is contrasting the manifest text with a latent text which is the result of the lapses, distortions, silences and absences in the manifest text. The latent text is the “diary of the struggle” of the unposed question to be posed and answered.\n\n(6) Ideology is a practice with lived and material dimensions. It has costumes, rituals, behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. The State employs Ideological Apparatuses (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices and productions: (organized) religion, the education system, the family, (organized) politics, the media, the industries of culture.\n\n“All ideology has the function (which defines it) of ‘constructing’\n\nconcrete individuals as subjects”\n\nSubjects to what? The answer: to the material practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects) is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”. These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.\n\nThese theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the Advertising and the film industries.\n\nThe ideology of consumption (which is, undeniably, the most material of all practices) uses advertising to transform individuals to subjects (=to consumers). It uses advertising to interpellate them. The advertisements attract attention, force people to introduce meaning to them and, as a result, to consume. The most famous example is the use of “People like you (buy this or do that)” in ads. The reader / viewer is interpellated both as an individual (“you”) and as a member of a group (“people like…”). He occupies the empty (imaginary) space of the “you” in the ad. This is ideological “misrecognition”. First, many others misrecognize themselves as that “you” (an impossibility in the real world). Secondly, the misrecognized “you” exists only in the ad because it was created by it, it has no real world correlate.\n\nThe reader or viewer of the ad is transformed into the subject of (and subject to) the material practice of the ideology (consumption, in this case).\n\nAlthusser was a Marxist. The dominant mode of production in his days (and even more so today) was capitalism. His implied criticism of the material dimensions of ideological practices should be taken with more than a grain of salt. Interpellated by the ideology of Marxism himself, he generalized on his personal experience and described ideologies as infallible, omnipotent, ever successful. Ideologies, to him, were impeccably functioning machines which can always be relied upon to reproduce subjects with all the habits and thought patterns required by the dominant mode of production.\n\nAnd this is where Althusser fails, trapped by dogmatism and more than a touch of paranoia. He neglects to treat two all-important questions (his problematic may have not allowed it):\n\n(a) What do ideologies look for? Why do they engage in their practice? What is the ultimate goal?\n\n(b) What happens in a pluralistic environment rich in competing ideologies?\n\nAlthusser stipulates the existence of two texts, manifest and hidden. The latter co-exists with the former, very much as a black figure defines its white background. The background is also a figure and it is only arbitrarily – the result of historical conditioning – that we bestow a preferred status upon the one. The latent text can be extracted from the manifest one by listening to the absences, the lapses and the silences in the manifest text.\n\nBut: what dictates the laws of extraction? how do we know that the latent text thus exposed is THE right one? Surely, there must exist a procedure of comparison, authentication and verification of the latent text?\n\nA comparison of the resulting latent text to the manifest text from which it was extracted would be futile because it would be recursive. This is not even a process of iteration. It is teutological. There must exist a THIRD, “master-text”, a privileged text, historically invariant, reliable, unequivocal (indifferent to interpretation-frameworks), universally accessible, atemporal and non-spatial. This third text is COMPLETE in the sense that it includes both the manifest and the latent. Actually, it should include all the possible texts (a LIBRARY function). The historical moment will determine which of them will be manifest and which latent, according to the needs of the mode of production and the various practices. Not all these texts will be conscious and accessible to the individual but such a text would embody and dictate the rules of comparison between the manifest text and ITSELF (the Third Text) , being the COMPLETE text.\n\nOnly through a comparison between a partial text and a complete text can the deficiencies of the partial text be exposed. A comparison between partial texts will yield no certain results and a comparison between the text and itself (as Althusser suggests) is absolutely meaningless.\n\nThis Third Text is the human psyche. We constantly compare texts that we read to this Third Text, a copy of which we all carry with us. We are unaware of most of the texts incorporated in this master text of ours. When faced with a manifest text which is new to us, we first “download” the “rules of comparison (engagement)”. We sift through the manifest text. We compare it to our COMPLETE master text and see which parts are missing. These constitute the latent text. The manifest text serves as a trigger which brings to our consciousness appropriate and relevant portions of the Third Text. It also generates the latent text in us.\n\nIf this sounds familiar it is because this pattern of confronting (the manifest text), comparing (with our master text) and storing the results (the latent text and the manifest text are brought to consciousness) – is used by mother nature itself. The DNA is such a “Master Text, Third Text”. It includes all the genetic-biological texts some manifest, some latent. Only stimuli in its environment (=a manifest text) can provoke it to generate its own (hitherto latent) “text”. The same would apply to computer applications.\n\nThe Third Text, therefore, has an invariant nature (it includes all possible texts) – and, yet, is changeable by interacting with manifest texts. This contradiction is only apparent. The Third Text does not change – only different parts of it are brought to our awareness as a result of the interaction with the manifest text. We can also safely say that one does not need to be an Althusserian critic or engage in “scientific” discourse to deconstruct the problematic. Every reader of text immediately and always deconstructs it. The very act of reading involves comparison with the Third Text which inevitably leads to the generation of a latent text.\n\nAnd this precisely is why some interpellations fail. The subject deconstructs every message even if he is not trained in critical practice. He is interpellated or fails to be interpellated depending on what latent message was generated through the comparison with the Third Text. And because the Third Text includes ALL possible texts, the subject is given to numerous competing interpellations offered by many ideologies, mostly at odds with each other. The subject is in an environment of COMPETING INTERPELLATIONS (especially in this day and age of information glut). The failure of one interpellation – normally means the success of another (whose interpellation is based on the latent text generated in the comparison process or on a manifest text of its own, or on a latent text generated by another text).\n\nThere are competing ideologies even in the most severe of authoritarian regimes. Sometimes, IASs within the same social formation offer competing ideologies: the political Party, the Church, the Family, the Army, the Media, the Civilian Regime, the Bureaucracy. To assume that interpellations are offered to the potential subjects successively (and not in parallel) defies experience (though it does simplify the thought-system).\n\nClarifying the HOW, though, does not shed light on the WHY.\n\nAdvertising leads to the interpellation of the subject to effect the material practice of consumption. Put more simply: there is money involved. Other ideologies – propagated through organized religions, for instance – lead to prayer. Could this be the material practice that they are looking for? No way. Money, prayer, the very ability to interpellate – they are all representations of power over other human beings. The business concern, the church, the political party, the family, the media, the culture industries – are all looking for the same thing: influence, power, might. Absurdly, interpellation is used to secure one paramount thing: the ability to interpellate. Behind every material practice stands a psychological practice (very much as the Third Text – the psyche – stands behind every text, latent or manifest).\n\nThe media could be different: money, spiritual prowess, physical brutality, subtle messages. But everyone (even individuals in their private life) is looking to hail and interpellate others and thus manipulate them to succumb to their material practices. A short sighted view would say that the businessman interpellates in order to make money. But the important question is: what ever for? What drives ideologies to establish material practices and to interpellate people to participate in them and become subjects? The will to power. the wish to be able to interpellate. It is this cyclical nature of Althusser’s teachings (ideologies interpellate in order to be able to interpellate) and his dogmatic approach (ideologies never fail) which doomed his otherwise brilliant observations to oblivion. In Althusser’s writings the Marxist determination remains as Over-determination. This is a structured articulation of a number of contradictions and determinations (between the practices). This is very reminiscent of Freud’s Dream Theory and of the concept of Superposition in Quantum Mechanics."},{title:"Enlightenment Is Not Just One State",body:"Many people has the notion that enlightenment is one state. Many also believe that when it is attained, a person is forever in that state.\n\nThe following is not a definitive article on this subject. It is just an expression of my own thoughts.\n\nMy opinion is that enlightenment is not just one state but is a progressive and gradual establishing of states of consciousness.\n\nI, myself have not reach the end of the road. But from years on a spiritual quest, I can safely say that enlightenment happens in a series or stages of self-realisations and self-discoveries.\n\nUsually there is a difference between an initial awakening and a later stabilisation of that stage that happens through practice or experiences. The initial awakenings are new discoveries about the dynamics of consciousness, while the stabilisation is the assimilation of what is being discovered into one’s life experience. Sometimes, a new discovery can completely over-rule or modify upon an older one.\n\nAlmost all stages of enlightenment can be said to be associated with Presence. However, the enlightening Presence comes in various degrees of intensity and clarity. The degree of intensity is directly dependent on the level and depth of one’s clarity as well as one’s realisations/discoveries.\n\nAlso, as one progresses along, the relationship or connections of oneself to the universe and existence at large also becomes clearer.\n\nBelow very briefly illustrates the progressive and stage-based nature of enlightenment:\n\nWhen one first begin meditating, one may first experience the all-pervading Presence. This Presence, is most often experienced when thoughts are momentarily suspended. This Presence which exists in the Eternal Present Moment is our true self.\n\nHowever such an experience can only be classified as an awakening to the true self.. which is no-self. This is because, after the meditation, the Presence seems to have disappeared. One cannot understand and find the connection of presence to our everyday life. Therefore one will have difficulty re-acquiring the Presence. And it takes many stages and series of realisation to understand the relationship of Presence to our phenomenal world. It can be said that the prolonged sustaining of Presence is dependent on the stages and depth of realisation.\n\nAlso, during the earlier stages we may mistaken another state to be the pure presence. For example, we may mistaken ‘I AM’ for pure presence. This is because the thinking mind has created a reflective image of Pure Presence. This reflection of the absolute is ‘I AM’.\n\nUsually, in order to pass through the ‘I AM’ stage, the person must move unto even deeper understandings. These understandings may include realising that one’s personality is not the doer of action. This stage may persist for a while before the person realises the illusion of subject-object division. This stage involves recognising the hypnotic impression of there being an observer and the being observed. Here is where one begins to see through the illusionary nature of our phenomenal world.\n\nI cannot comment on the stages before me as they are beyond me. Nevertheless, one can still see from the above description that enlightenment is not so straight-forward after all.\n\nFor your necessary discernment. Thank you for reading."},{title:"Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life",body:"I was always somebody who felt quite sorry for myself, what I had not got compared to my friends, how much of a struggle my life seemed to be compared to others. I was caught up in a web of negativity and needed someone or something to help me to escape.\n\nDuring an afternoon at work one day, aged around twenty one, a colleague I was working with started to talk to me. What he said was quite upsetting and disturbing, however would have a profound effect on my future. He said to me:\n\n“Your quite a depressive person, aren’t you?”\n\n“Am I?”\n\nI said in a shocked voice as I believed I was no different to anybody else. He continued:\n\n“Yes you are. You very rarely smile, you are negative about most issues and you always seem to be carrying the world on your shoulders”.\n\nThis man was aged around fifty three and continued:\n\n“I used to be like you and then I was given some advice, of which I am now going to relay to you. When you feel down, depressed or sorry for yourself, read the newspapers or watch the news on the television. You may then realise that you are in fact one of the lucky ones.”\n\nI listened and thought about what he had said. I had never been a big reader or watcher of the news, but decided to start. The advice was totally correct, the news from around the world and even my own country was quite shocking. I realised that the worries I had were actually quite trivial and that I needed to cherish everyday and start to look on the bright side of life."},{title:"Words To Live By",body:"Watching the news the other day, it occurred to me that people who have “words to live by” often begin to attack and even kill others. I thought back to my own angry youth, when I could easily use words to justify violent thoughts which might have become violent actions. Words are tools, and yet it seems that they can be more dangerous than gunpowder.\n\nImagine two men facing each other, pointing past one another. One is pointing at a tornado that is coming, and the other at a raging fire headed towards them. Each sees their own truth and is angry at the sight of the other’s hand. Each feels that the other’s hand is “wrong.” This may seem silly, but replace the tornado and fire with any modern issues, and the hands with words, and this scene describes how we often try to communicate.\n\nWe point past each other with our words, arguing as though we are looking at the same facts and experiences. We want to prove our words are the right ones, instead of learning to look at what the other’s words are pointing at. Words are seductive, and for all their undeniable usefulness, they also can lead us away from understanding when we focus on them, when we make them more important than the truth they are meant to point at.\n\nThere Are No Words To Live By\n\nThis isn’t just about communication with others. We focus on, and get trapped in a net of words that we use to explain the world to ourselves. We call things “right” or “wrong” for example, according to how they compare to our “definitions.” Unlike mathematics, though, word formulas and definitions can never be so precise. They cannot encompass the whole truth of reality. For example, with the least effort, you can create a circumstance where “stealing” would be right, and “helping” someone wrong. This isn’t an argument against using language or logic. It is just that both only go so far. Like a car that takes you across the country or world, they are useful, but like a car, they are only useful in certain ways, and you have to get out of them when you arrive at your various destinations. Taking a car to the lake isn’t a problem, but taking it into the lake is. This is what we do when our words and logic take us to dangerous situations.\n\nCan having words to live by be dangerous, though? Absolutely. I once heard an otherwise compassionate person say he was against animal cruelty laws because he couldn’t find a logical and defensible set of words to defend them. If he saw a new machine, would he refuse to believe it existed until he could explain it and describe it? Reality, and the reality of right and wrong exist outside of words – they are not the words themselves.\n\nI watched a man say on the evening news that we have the right to drop a nuclear bomb on Iraq, and that we should. As he explained why, you could see that whatever compassionate impulses he had, they were over-ruled by his total allegiance to his words, logic, and where these take him. It never occurred to him that maybe there is truth outside of his words and logic. It’s great to have guidelines, like “don’t lie,” or “we have the right to defend ourselves.” It is even better to remember that these rules will someday fail us, and we will have to make new ones. Words are just tools. There are words to die by, but there are no words to live by."},{title:"Religion And Science",body:"There are many kinds of narratives and organizing principles. Science is driven by evidence gathered in experiments, and by the falsification of extant theories and their replacement with newer, asymptotically truer, ones. Other systems – religion, nationalism, paranoid ideation, or art – are based on personal experiences (faith, inspiration, paranoia, etc.).\n\nExperiential narratives can and do interact with evidential narratives and vice versa. For instance: belief in God inspires some scientists who regard science as a method to “peek at God’s cards” and to get closer to Him. Another example: the pursuit of scientific endeavors enhances one’s national pride and is motivated by it. Science is often corrupted in order to support nationalistic and racist claims.\n\nThe basic units of all narratives are known by their effects on the environment. God, in this sense, is no different from electrons, quarks, and black holes. All four constructs cannot be directly observed, but the fact of their existence is derived from their effects.\n\nGranted, God’s effects are discernible only in the social and psychological (or psychopathological) realms. But this observed constraint doesn’t render Him less “real”. The hypothesized existence of God parsimoniously explains a myriad ostensibly unrelated phenomena and, therefore, conforms to the rules governing the formulation of scientific theories.\n\nThe locus of God’s hypothesized existence is, clearly and exclusively, in the minds of believers. But this again does not make Him less real. The contents of our minds are as real as anything “out there”. Actually, the very distinction between epistemology and ontology is blurred.\n\nBut is God’s existence “true” – or is He just a figment of our neediness and imagination?\n\nTruth is the measure of the ability of our models to describe phenomena and predict them. God’s existence (in people’s minds) succeeds to do both. For instance, assuming that God exists allows us to predict many of the behaviors of people who profess to believe in Him. The existence of God is, therefore, undoubtedly true (in this formal and strict sense).\n\nBut does God exist outside people’s minds? Is He an objective entity, independent of what people may or may not think about Him? After all, if all sentient beings were to perish in a horrible calamity, the Sun would still be there, revolving as it has done from time immemorial.\n\nIf all sentient beings were to perish in a horrible calamity, would God still exist? If all sentient beings, including all humans, stop believing that there is God – would He survive this renunciation? Does God “out there” inspire the belief in God in religious folks’ minds?\n\nKnown things are independent of the existence of observers (although the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics disputes this). Believed things are dependent on the existence of believers.\n\nWe know that the Sun exists. We don’t know that God exists. We believe that God exists – but we don’t and cannot know it, in the scientific sense of the word. We can design experiments to falsify (prove wrong) the existence of electrons, quarks, and black holes (and, thus, if all these experiments fail, prove that electrons, quarks, and black holes exist). We can also design experiments to prove that electrons, quarks, and black holes exist. But we cannot design even one experiment to falsify the existence of a God who is outside the minds of believers (and, thus, if the experiment fails, prove that God exists “out there”). Additionally, we cannot design even one experiment to prove that God exists outside the minds of believers. What about the “argument from design”? The universe is so complex and diverse that surely it entails the existence of a supreme intelligence, the world’s designer and creator, known by some as “God”. On the other hand, the world’s richness and variety can be fully accounted for using modern scientific theories such as evolution and the big bang. There is no need to introduce God into the equations.\n\nStill, it is possible that God is responsible for it all. The problem is that we cannot design even one experiment to falsify this theory, that God created the Universe (and, thus, if the experiment fails, prove that God is, indeed, the world’s originator). Additionally, we cannot design even one experiment to prove that God created the world. We can, however, design numerous experiments to falsify the scientific theories that explain the creation of the Universe (and, thus, if these experiments fail, lend these theories substantial support). We can also design experiments to prove the scientific theories that explain the creation of the Universe. It does not mean that these theories are absolutely true and immutable. They are not. Our current scientific theories are partly true and are bound to change with new knowledge gained by experimentation. Our current scientific theories will be replaced by newer, truer theories. But any and all future scientific theories will be falsifiable and testable.\n\nKnowledge and belief are like oil and water. They don’t mix. Knowledge doesn’t lead to belief and belief does not yield knowledge. Belief can yield conviction or strongly-felt opinions. But belief cannot result in knowledge.\n\nStill, both known things and believed things exist. The former exist “out there” and the latter “in our minds” and only there. But they are no less real for that."},{title:"When The Morning Dawns",body:"The following article covers a topic that has recently moved to center stage–at least it seems that way. If you’ve been thinking you need to know more about unconditional love, here’s your opportunity.\n\nWhen darkness turns to day, the sun moves over the horizon and touches everything in sight. This movement across the landscape brightens everything. Such an illumination awakens us all. We rise with energy moving in and through us allowing us to create a new day. A day unique from all the rest and creatively woven into our soul.  This is the landscape of our soul. As you can see, nature has a way of showing us just how powerful we are. The same power that created the moon and the stars and the movement of all space and time lies within the human heart. It is the heart of creation itself, and perhaps, the heart of our Creator. \n\nHuman beings are fortunate to be able to be aware of our awareness. This awareness gives us an opportunity to reflect on our soul and find blessing in being alive. Our consciousness of a creative force inside us guiding us into this world, through it, and eventually to our eternal home allows us to fulfill a purpose on this earth.  Such a purpose is beyond our own ability to really know. Yet, we can open our heart enough to allow our purpose to find us. This is done by recognizing that the things in life that really matter ARE the things in life that isn’t matter.  Yes, it is our soul’s longing to fulfill the purpose for which we came to earth for. No one really knows how a baby is conceived totally. Science and human understanding still hasn’t been able to fully comprehend such a force of nature. We can only embrace what is beyond us and find a way to bring into being forces of nature such as a tiny child.  When a child is born, we are in awe. The miracle of birth creates something inside us all. It is the remembrance that life does not come from us. Instead, life comes through us. As such, we are living in a dream come true. All of us are probably living our soul’s purpose more than we know, and even, can know. It is the mystery of all mysteries. \n\nThis does not explain why some of us find peace and other’s find pain. But, such a philosophy will enable us all to find grace in knowing our lives create in our world facets of ourselves we all are a part of. An understanding of such grace gives every one of us a chance to find mercy and grace and the same unconditional love we came into the world with when we were born. \n\nSamuel Oliver, author of, “What the Dying Teach Us: Lessons on Living”"},{title:"Comment On The Importance Of Human Life",body:"The preservation of human life is the ultimate value, a pillar of ethics and the foundation of all morality. This held true in most cultures and societies throughout history.\n\nOn first impression, the last sentence sounds patently wrong. We all know about human collectives that regarded human lives as dispensable, that murdered and tortured, that cleansed and annihilated whole populations in recurrent genocides. Surely, these defy the aforementioned statement?\n\nLiberal philosophies claim that human life was treated as a prime value throughout the ages. Authoritarian regimes do not contest the over-riding importance of this value. Life is sacred, valuable, to be cherished and preserved. But, in totalitarian societies, it can be deferred, subsumed, subjected to higher goals, quantized, and, therefore, applied with differential rigor in the following circumstances:  1.. Quantitative – when a lesser evil prevents a greater one. Sacrificing the lives of the few to save the lives of the many is a principle enshrined and embedded in activities such as war and medicinal care. All cultures, no matter how steeped (or rooted) in liberal lore accept it. They all send soldiers to die to save the more numerous civilian population. Medical doctors sacrifice lives daily, to save others.\n\nIt is boils down to a quantitative assessment (“the numerical ratio between those saved and those sacrificed”), and to questions of quality (“are there privileged lives whose saving or preservation is worth the sacrifice of others’ lives?”) and of evaluation (no one can safely predict the results of such moral dilemmas – will lives be saved as the result of the sacrifice?).  2.. Temporal – when sacrificing life (voluntarily or not) in the present secures a better life for others in the future. These future lives need not be more numerous than the lives sacrificed. A life in the future immediately acquires the connotation of youth in need of protection. It is the old sacrificed for the sake of the new, a trade off between those who already had their share of life – and those who hadn’t. It is the bloody equivalent of a savings plan: one defers present consumption to the future.\n\nThe mirror image of this temporal argument belongs to the third group (see next), the qualitative one. It prefers to sacrifice a life in the present so that another life, also in the present, will continue to exist in the future. Abortion is an instance of this approach: the life of the child is sacrificed to secure the future well-being of the mother. In Judaism, it is forbidden to kill a female bird. Better to kill its off-spring. The mother has the potential to compensate for this loss of life by bringing giving birth to other chicks.  3.. Qualitative – This is an especially vicious variant because it purports to endow subjective notions and views with “scientific” objectivity. People are judged to belong to different qualitative groups (classified by race, skin color, birth, gender, age, wealth, or other arbitrary parameters). The result of this immoral taxonomy is that the lives of the “lesser” brands of humans are considered less “weighty” and worthy than the lives of the upper grades of humanity. The former are therefore sacrificed to benefit the latter. The Jews in Nazi occupied Europe, the black slaves in America, the aborigines in Australia are three examples of such pernicious thinking.  4.. Utilitarian – When the sacrifice of one life brings another person material or other benefits. This is the thinking (and action) which characterizes psychopaths and sociopathic criminals, for instance. For them, life is a tradable commodity and it can be exchanged against inanimate goods and services. Money and drugs are bartered for life."
},{title:"The Idea Of God Is Not Henceforth Relevant",body:"Well educated, intellectual people, especially scientists at all times demonstrate considerably smaller adherence to religiosity than others. However, there are still believers of the idea of the God in science. If we exclude from their number those who feel a painful requirement for external protection and support by virtue of their poor living circumstances, there are those who come to idea of the God as a result of amazement at a world that has many unsolved problems. The surprising diversification of subjects and entities can be scientifically formulated in principle as it can sustain the quasi-stable condition and demonstrates development.\n\nCommon sense suggests, that for an explanation of the observable diversification in life, it is necessary to admit that each separate subject, each organism, each social unit, and even each computer program should contain a special internal causative engine, a local determinism, which maintains an autonomous internal life in it. The conventional concept of determinism does not suppose the existence of such sources. This represents a scandalous weakness in the concept. Not finding the required causative source within the framework of philosophy, people are compelled to address the always-available, exotic, exciting fantasies of the irrational sources that are available in religion and mysticism.  Today the situation can be considerably rectified. The recently published concept of Ring Determinism identifies the required internal causative source by way of a closed plot of the customary causal chain. This is a self-contained circuit which, it turns out, is contained in the entrails of each separate natural formation. This circuit is just that ontological base in which each separate natural formation finds and displays its exclusive individuality and asserts itself in the capacity of “causa sui ” – the cause of itself. Internal local causative action, continuously circulating inside a separate body, is transmitted from element to element. It ensures its systemic, synergetic wholeness in the operation of its elements and subsystems in the phenomena of “emergence”, special internal policy, resistance to external actions, aggression directed externally, egotism, egocentricity, self-preservation, self-organization and finally, self-development. One of the conclusions of ring determinism is, that under the supervisory control of the internal cause continuously circulating in a body, and under the continuous effects of external factors, there is the miracle of self-development. This results in an observable diversification of surprising properties of subjects, organisms, social units, human products and other things. The local causative circuit can randomly or by design, become closed. Then finding an ability towards long-lived quasi-stable self-maintenance, self-resumption, or, in the case of dynamically developing systems, the determining vortex, it becomes the high-power engine which creates, saves and induces a flock of living and nonliving natural formations in development.\n\nEducated people can now sigh with relief since a rather weighty rational argument against the idea of creationism has appeared and the necessity to appeal to irrational theories has vanished."},{title:"Philosophy As A Science",body:"Philosophy is considered a science but it is difficult to say, when one has to compare with an ordinary science, for example biology, or chemistry. This is a question that turns into a burning problem among the scientists and linguists all over the world. Can philosophy be a science? What does philosophy operate with? It operates with categories, which can be as wide and as interchangeable as one can only imagine. Ordinary science operates with definitions, which are quite limited in their field of research. Ordinary science uses terms and laws of that very science to continue the research, uniting with the others in very rare cases. Philosophy gets into the sense of every science trying to achieve results.\n\nWe also can not call philosophy a supra-science, for it also uses hypothesis and arguments to state the opinion. But there is the obvious thing: there are now laws in philosophy and never will be, for the science changes with the age, the needs, beliefs and requirements of the citizens. To prove your opinion, you can write the definition essay and state all the facts and arguments you know to prove one way or another. This is also a nice way to research the problem and see what the solution is. But you have to research it carefully; otherwise definition essays will not be fruitful. As all sciences philosophy has gone through its stages of development. Some scientists believe that the crib of philosophy was mythology and religion. If to see the principles of life and some primitive morals stated in some myths we may see that the statement is quite true and philosophy still continues to develop out of social beliefs and ideas. Philosophy is a science which is obligatory learned by every college student in order for him to establish his own philosophy of life. It is quite exciting to find answers to ever existing questions: who am I? What do I know? What can I know? What am I destined to do? Here is one more interesting observation. You can see that all famous philosophers were researching other science fields also. For example, Freud, Yung, Kafka and others were doing research in linguistics and social sciences. Their numerous creations are the pride of human history for they revealed some secrets that remained undiscovered for a long time before their great contributions.\n\nThere are so many currents and branches, so many schools of philosophy that it is hard to decide, which one do you prefer and agree with. This much depends on the country, family, society you live in. This is one more difference between philosophy and other natural sciences. The law is stable for any country; gravity exists in India, same as in Brazil. Philosophy is a hard science, for it is very difficult to understand the sense of the dogma reading it only once. It is of course, not easy, but gives credit for you if you get interested and somewhere, being at the social event you quote one of the famous doctors of philosophy and make a great impression of an educated and intelligent personality."},{title:"On Being Human",body:"Are we human because of unique traits and attributes not shared with either animal or machine? The definition of “human” is circular: we are human by virtue of the properties that make us human (i.e., distinct from animal and machine). It is a definition by negation: that which separates us from animal and machine is our “human-ness”.\n\nWe are human because we are not animal, nor machine. But such thinking has been rendered progressively less tenable by the advent of evolutionary and neo-evolutionary theories which postulate a continuum in nature between animals and Man.\n\nOur uniqueness is partly quantitative and partly qualitative. Many animals are capable of cognitively manipulating symbols and using tools. Few are as adept at it as we are. These are easily quantifiable differences – two of many.\n\nQualitative differences are a lot more difficult to substantiate. In the absence of privileged access to the animal mind, we cannot and don’t know if animals feel guilt, for instance. Do animals love? Do they have a concept of sin? What about object permanence, meaning, reasoning, self-awareness, critical thinking? Individuality? Emotions? Empathy? Is artificial intelligence (AI) an oxymoron? A machine that passes the Turing Test may well be described as “human”. But is it really? And if it is not – why isn’t it?\n\nLiterature is full of stories of monsters – Frankenstein, the Golem – and androids or anthropoids. Their behaviour is more “humane” than the humans around them. This, perhaps, is what really sets humans apart: their behavioural unpredictability. It is yielded by the interaction between Mankind’s underlying immutable genetically-determined nature – and Man’s kaleidoscopically changing environments.\n\nThe Constructivists even claim that Human Nature is a mere cultural artefact. Sociobiologists, on the other hand, are determinists. They believe that human nature – being the inevitable and inexorable outcome of our bestial ancestry – cannot be the subject of moral judgment.\n\nAn improved Turing Test would look for baffling and erratic patterns of misbehaviour to identify humans. Pico della Mirandola wrote in “Oration on the Dignity of Man” that Man was born without a form and can mould and transform – actually, create – himself at will. Existence precedes essence, said the Existentialists centuries later.\n\nThe one defining human characteristic may be our awareness of our mortality. The automatically triggered, “fight or flight”, battle for survival is common to all living things (and to appropriately programmed machines). Not so the catalytic effects of imminent death. These are uniquely human. The appreciation of the fleeting translates into aesthetics, the uniqueness of our ephemeral life breeds morality, and the scarcity of time gives rise to ambition and creativity.\n\nIn an infinite life, everything materializes at one time or another, so the concept of choice is spurious. The realization of our finiteness forces us to choose among alternatives. This act of selection is predicated upon the existence of “free will”. Animals and machines are thought to be devoid of choice, slaves to their genetic or human programming.\n\nYet, all these answers to the question: “What does it mean to be human” – are lacking.\n\nThe set of attributes we designate as human is subject to profound alteration. Drugs, neuroscience, introspection, and experience all cause irreversible changes in these traits and characteristics. The accumulation of these changes can lead, in principle, to the emergence of new properties, or to the abolition of old ones.\n\nAnimals and machines are not supposed to possess free will or exercise it. What, then, about fusions of machines and humans (bionics)? At which point does a human turn into a machine? And why should we assume that free will ceases to exist at that – rather arbitrary – point?\n\nIntrospection – the ability to construct self-referential and recursive models of the world – is supposed to be a uniquely human quality. What about introspective machines? Surely, say the critics, such machines are PROGRAMMED to introspect, as opposed to humans. To qualify as introspection, it must be WILLED, they continue. Yet, if introspection is willed – WHO wills it? Self-willed introspection leads to infinite regression and formal logical paradoxes.\n\nMoreover, the notion – if not the formal concept – of “human” rests on many hidden assumptions and conventions.\n\nPolitical correctness notwithstanding – why presume that men and women (or different races) are identically human? Aristotle thought they were not. A lot separates males from females – genetically (both genotype and phenotype) and environmentally (culturally). What is common to these two sub-species that makes them both “human”?\n\nCan we conceive of a human without body (i.e., a Platonian Form, or soul)? Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas think not. A soul has no existence separate from the body. A machine-supported energy field with mental states similar to ours today – would it be considered human? What about someone in a state of coma – is he or she (or it) fully human?\n\nIs a new born baby human – or, at least, fully human – and, if so, in which sense? What about a future human race – whose features would be unrecognizable to us? Machine-based intelligence – would it be thought of as human? If yes, when would it be considered human?\n\nIn all these deliberations, we may be confusing “human” with “person”. The former is a private case of the latter. Locke’s person is a moral agent, a being responsible for its actions. It is constituted by the continuity of its mental states accessible to introspection.\n\nLocke’s is a functional definition. It readily accommodates non-human persons (machines, energy matrices) if the functional conditions are satisfied. Thus, an android which meets the prescribed requirements is more human than a brain dead person.\n\nDescartes’ objection that one cannot specify conditions of singularity and identity over time for disembodied souls is right only if we assume that such “souls” possess no energy. A bodiless intelligent energy matrix which maintains its form and identity over time is conceivable. Certain AI and genetic software programs already do it.\n\nStrawson is Cartesian and Kantian in his definition of a “person” as a “primitive”. Both the corporeal predicates and those pertaining to mental states apply equally, simultaneously, and inseparably to all the individuals of that type of entity. Human beings are one such entity. Some, like Wiggins, limit the list of possible persons to animals – but this is far from rigorously necessary and is unduly restrictive.\n\nThe truth is probably in a synthesis:\n\nA person is any type of fundamental and irreducible entity whose typical physical individuals (i.e., members) are capable of continuously experiencing a range of states of consciousness and permanently having a list of psychological attributes.\n\nThis definition allows for non-animal persons and recognizes the personhood of a brain damaged human (“capable of experiencing”). It also incorporates Locke’s view of humans as possessing an ontological status similar to “clubs” or “nations” – their personal identity consists of a variety of interconnected psychological continuities."},{title:"A Brief History Of Creation",body:"What is the loop of Creation? How is there something from nothing? In spite of the fact that it is impossible to prove that anything exists beyond one’s perception since any such proof would involve one’s perception (I observed it, I heard it, I thought about it, I calculated it, and etc.), science deals with a so-called objective reality “out there,” beyond one’s perception professing to describe Nature objectively (as if there was a Nature or reality external to one’s perception). The shocking impact of Matrix was precisely the valid possibility that what we believed to be reality was but our perception; however, this was presented through showing a real reality wherein the perceived reality was a computer simulation. Many who toy with the idea that perhaps, indeed, we are computer simulations, deviate towards questions, such as, who could create such software and what kind of hardware would be needed for such a feat. Although such questions assume that reality is our perception, they also axiomatically presuppose the existence of an objective deterministic world “out there” that nevertheless must be responsible for how we perceive our reality. This is a major mistake emphasizing technology and algorithms instead of trying to discover the nature of reality and the structure of creation. As will be shown in the following, the required paradigm shift from “perception is our reality fixed within an objective world,” to “perception is reality without the need of an objective world ‘out there,'” is provided by a dynamic logical structure. The Holophanic loop logic is responsible for a consistent and complete worldview that not only describes, but also creates whatever can be perceived or experienced.\n\nStating that it is impossible to prove the existence of anything beyond one’s perception is not saying there is nothing beyond perception, only that if there is anything, then whatever that is, is indefinite. It could be argued that the existence of physical laws, the universal perception that the apple falls to the ground is proof of an objective reality. However, this universal agreement is also our perception. It could be argued that if we cannot decide what to perceive, and everybody perceives the same physical reality, then there must be some lawfulness that dictates how we perceive and therefore, this lawfulness could be external to our perception. However, this lawfulness, as we shall see later on, is the precise lawfulness that creates perception, the process of definition, which is not external to perception (this process creates the perceived and the perceiver, which then gives meaning to this process – a loop – but about that, later). It could be argued, that hitting our knee on the table – whether we believe in the table or not – will hurt. The table is external to our body, but not to our perception. What then is perception? It is relating, a process of definition, defining and thereby rendering meaningful what has been perceived.\n\nWhat then is this process of definition? It is creating borders within which one’s perception gains meaning. The word “definition” comes from the Latin de finire, meaning, making finite or limited. In Hebrew, definition is HAGDARA (הגדרה), meaning, to border. Any definition necessarily implies what the definition is not, or stated differently, to have meaning, whatever is defined explicitly includes the meaning by implicitly excluding everything else. Consequently, to define means to place the defined object within borders that by default create something beyond the borders of the definition. What is this something beyond the defined? The implicitly excluded everything else, or in other words, the indefinite. The paramount importance of incorporating the indefinite within a consistent logical structure cannot be overemphasized. The indefinite itself is a paradox, and incorporating it within the Holophanic logical structure engenders the loop of Creation where the dynamic structure of paradoxes is both the creative force of existence, and also the proof of the necessity of existence.\n\nTo better grasp the impetus of Creation, let’s look at the indefinite and paradoxes. What does “indefinite” mean? Anything as long as it is not specified (not defined); anything that appears both within and beyond the borders of the definition and thereby rendering the border superfluous, which means, no border, no definition. If nevertheless we would attempt to define the notion “indefinite,” then that’s a paradox because if we succeed, then it is defined, which contradicts its meaning – its indefiniteness – and the word “indefinite” means that it cannot be defined. This is an example of a paradox, that in essence means, if it is what it is, then it is not what it is, yet if it is not what it is, then it is what it is. A paradox is a creature that consists of a structure (how it is defined, the dynamic process on its way to stabilization) that contradicts its significance (what it is, the stabilized entity). What characterizes a paradox is the motion between its structure and significance, where the structure implies that its significance contradicts its structure, and vice versa.\n\nAnother example of a paradox would be “wholeness.” Wholeness (totality, infinite, boundless) can only be wholeness if we can find a way to define it so that it includes everything and there is nothing beyond it. However, if we define wholeness, then to have meaning, it must be bordered within the walls of the definition, which implies that there is something beyond this border, in which case it is not wholeness. Or in more formal language, wholeness is only wholeness if it is not wholeness, which is an inconsistency. If we are satisfied with that, then we have completed the definition of wholeness. However, if we try to include the beyond created by our earlier definition within the borders of our next attempt at defining wholeness, then we gain a new definition of wholeness, which by the sheer structure of the process of defining creates a new beyond. In this case, the process of defining wholeness will be consistent but incomplete, and wholeness will remain indefinite.\n\nContemplating the paradox of Creation, the ancient Egyptian myth of Creation springs to mind, the myth of the self-creating god, Amun (or Amon). Amun masturbated and swallowed his semen, after which he spit it out in the form of a ball, thereby impregnating his mother, the sky. And only then, was he born. Thus Amun was his own father. Those pious who discovered the illustrated version of this myth in Karnak covered up the erect phallus of Amun, and with it, this story of Creation was laid into obscurity. The Holophanic model of Creation could regard this Egyptian myth as Amun retromorphously creating himself. I have coined the word retromorphous to mean, defining in retrospect, turning non-being into the potential of whatever the observation is made from, or in other words, creating the past from the present, creating the source from its outcome, which is the basis of complexity in the context of the loop logic. That is, only after Amun was born can he give meaning to his mother, the potential from which he emanated and to the process that created him (as represented by masturbation and incest) whereby he was born. Of course, neither the sky nor the masturbating Amun have meaning until Creation takes place de facto and Amun emerges. I find this an enticing illustration of the basic paradox of existence.\n\nSo how can there be something from nothing? What is “nothing?” Nothing is what didn’t turn into the potential of something. If there was something from nothing, then that nothing would have turned into the potential of something, because when we ask, how is there something from nothing, we ask this question from something, when something already exists. If we take a deeper look at “nothing,” we’ll discover that “nothing” is a paradox. Any definition is something, so if we defined “nothing,” then it would become something, which contradicts its essence of being “nothing.” Another way of looking at “nothing” would be by means of it being something that is meaningless. That is, “nothing” could be something that does not relate and that no thing or no one relates to. That is, if there was something totally alone in the universe, then that would be nothing, but it would be meaningless. If such existed, its existence would be external to our perception, and as such, this “nothing” would be indefinite.\n\nWe said that the indefinite could be anything, as long as it is not specified (not defined). However, if we nevertheless tried to define “nothing” (the indefinite), what would we get then? Since “nothing” is non-definable, it is transparent as the object of our inquiry. So when we attempt to define it, all we have is what we put into it, which is the process of definition. “Nothing” stayed nothing, we didn’t define it, only made the process of definition explicit. “Nothing” gains meaning when we fail to define it; but having tried, we are left with a bonus, a something, which is our process of defining “nothing.” Creation of something from nothing is not a function of defining something, but a function of attempting to define “nothing.” And then, if that process of definition – which already is an existence – looks back at its origins, if this process of defining investigates into its own genesis, then what does it see? It sees itself. It sees the process of definition – self-reference. If there is nothing external to perception, then this process of definition is the overall wholeness, the creator of meaning when it can relate to itself. However, to have meaning, the process of definition has to be defined; this definition would be a self-referential quasi-infinite and continuous process of establishing borders that create the indefinite beyond that establishes borders creating the indefinite beyond that establishes borders… which means, wholeness would continuously and forever fail to define itself while succeeding to define something – anything but itself.\n\nOf course, both the totally defined and the totally indefinite are idealized notions that would be inconsistent with the Holophanic loop logic, nor can they be found in nature. The totally indefinite would be the total meaningless nothing, the kind of non-being that cannot be fathomed because if we would think about it, it would already be something. On the other hand, there can be no total definition either. I have used the term uncertainty of sameness to describe the logical impossibility of total definition. A defined entity can be said to have reached sameness      	"},{title:"Vampires The Romantic Ideology Behind Them",body:"The French Revolution constituted for the conscience of the dominant aristocratic class a fall from innocence, and upturning of the natural chain of events that resounded all over Europe; the old regime became, in their imaginary, a paradise lost. This explains why some romantic poets born in the higher classes were keen on seeing themselves as faded aristocrats, expelled from their comfortable milieu by a reverse of fortune or a design of destiny. Byron and Shelley are the prime instances of this vital pose. In The Giaour he writes on a vampiric character: “The common crowd but see the gloom/ Of wayward deeds and fitting doom;/ The close observer can espy/A noble soul, and lineage high.” \n\nByron departed from England leaving a trail of scandal over his marital conduct and since then saw himself as an exiled expatriate. Shelley was expelled from Oxford and he fell in disgrace by marrying an in-keeper’s daughter; he always struggled to reconcile his origin with his political ideas: “Shelley could find no way of resolving his own contradictory opinions” (Cronin, 2000).\n\nThis icon of the fallen aristocrat is rooted on another character revered by romantic poets: the fallen angel. As Mario Praz proves, miltonic Satan became the rebel figure of choice among romantic poets. Milton reversed the medieval idea of a hideous Satan and wrapped its figure with the epic grandeur of an angel fallen in disgrace. Many of the byronic heros share with Milton’s Satan this fallen-from-grace condition, such as Lara: “There was in him a vital scorn of all:/ As if the worst had fall’n which could befall,/ stood a stranger in this breathing world,/An erring spirit from another hurl’d” ( Lara XVIII 315-16)\n\nThere is another social factor that is behind the formation of the romantic myth of the vampire. In the early nineteen century, the foundations of what would later become a mass society were laid; the expansion of the press and of the reading public produced an increased diffusion for literary works and fostered movements such as the gothic and the sensation novel. Byron himself experienced the event of being turned into a proto-bestseller. The unification of literary taste and preferences that was a correlate to this social changes could not be more alien to the romantic notion of individual gusto and original sensibility. In order to combat this unifying forces, romantic poets revered the individual who stands outside society and is free from common concerns. Many of Byron’s heros look down on the masses from above, even though they walk among them and do not lean towards wordsworthian escapades into nature; they achieve to remain untainted by the masses in a sort of exile within the world akin to that of a ghost or a dammed spirit. This self-definition of Manfred is revelatory:\n\nFrom my youth upwards\n\nMy spirit walk’d not with the souls of men, Nor look’d upon the earth with human eyes; The thirst of their ambition was not mine, The aim of their existence was not mine; My joys, my griefs, my passions, and my powers Made me a stranger; though I wore the form, I had no sympathy with breathing flesh, (Manfred II, ii, 50-58)\n\nNot only Byron’s works contrived to produce the modern image of the vampire in relation to the Male Seducer archetype, but also some odd events in his life and the life of those surrounding him exercised a decisive influence. A critical study bundled with an anthology of vampire tales (Conde de Siruela, 2001) attributes to the short story The Vampire (1819) by John William Polidori the fixation of the “classical images of the literary vampire as a villanious, cold and enigmatic aristocrat; but, above all, perverse and fascinating for women”. Mario Praz, in the same line, also states that Byron was “largely responsible for the vogue of vampirism”. Polidori was the unfortunate doctor and personal assistant of Lord Byron who died half-crazy at 25. The idea for the tale published in 1819 came from the famous meetings at Villa Diodati on June 1816 between Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley and Polidori, in what was probably the most influential gathering for fantastic fiction in the history of modern literature. In order to pass the stormy and ether-fuelled nights, they agreed to write each one a ghost story. Mary Shelley (who was then 17 years old) got during these nights the idea of what later became Frankenstein and Polidori wrote the tale The Vampire that he would publish three years later. The story appeared in the New Monthly Magazine falsely attributed by the editor to Lord Byron (taking advantages of the aura of Satanism that surrounded the poet in the popular view to promote the sales of the magazine). A misguided Goethe hailed the story as the best that Lord Byron had ever written. The tale was, actually, a covert portrait of Lord Byron disguised as the vampire Lord Ruthven, a cruel gambler and killer of innocent girls. Polidori had introduced in the story fragments from an autobiographical and revengeful novel called Glenarvon written by Caroline Lamb, an ex-lover of Byron. The Lord      "},{title:"Peace On Earth A Wonderful Wish But No Way",body:"When asked, “If you could wish for one thing only, what would that wish be?” almost everyone; from beauty pagent contestants, to politicians, to religious leaders, to children, to the average person on the street states, “Peace On Earth” or “An end to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary, are meaningless. As long as humans exist there will never be peace on earth. Throughout the history of humankind there has never been peace on earth. Cavemen fought other cavemen over territory, food and even women. Cain killed Abel over God’s respect. Gabriel blew down the walls of Jericho. America fought the Revolutionary War for freedom and brother fought against brother in our Civil War for more freedom. There have always been wars and there will always be wars. As long as humans can think, there will be wars. Wars over such concepts as freedom, honor, dignity, etc.. Wars over territory, greed, power, prejudice, etc.. War is a part of human nature. For example, every human being is prejudiced. If they don’t like some race, nationality or religion, they don’t like short or tall or fat or skinny or smart or not smart or loud or quiet people. Some people don’t like children, some people don’t like old people, some people don’t like people with pets, or people that play their music too loud, or bad drivers, or people that believe in God or people that don’t believe in God. What is right and proper to some people can be wrong or even enraging to other people. Religion can not stop wars, in fact many wars are fought over religion (Note: I believe that religion is used as an excuse for war not the real reason for war.). Christians fought against Muslims during the Crusades, Many Muslims want death for all non believers. The Catholic Church killed heretics during the Inquisition. The Nazis killed millions of Jews and then started killing Catholics. The Russians under Stalin killed anyone even remotly religious. Protestants killed other Protestants for being the wrong type of Protestant. Muslims killed Muslims for being the wrong type of Muslim. Don’t forget about Atheists (I believe that Atheism is also a religion, it is a religion of non belief.), Stalin was an Atheist and wanted to get rid of all religion. Most of China’s leaders are Atheists and have jailed and killed huge numbers of religious people. History is rife with various types of religious battles. The main reason for war, however, is the lust for power. The power to make others do and believe as you do and believe, the power to make other people render unto you what you believe is rightfully yours, the power to make other people treat you as you believe you should be treated, the power to gain what you want (ie: money, love, respect, etc.), the power to punish others for doing things that you don’t believe they should do, the power to keep other from having things or thoughts that you don’t have. In other words, the power to be, in some ways God, to make everyone else in your image with you as their ruler. As long as people have the ability to think, there will be greed, envy, prejudice and anger. As long as those things exist, there will be wars. Most people believe, either religiously or secularly, in the rules set down in the Ten Commandments, but very few people can follow those rules all of the time because our ability to think causes us to want. Wanting causes us to break some or all of the rules. Humans are not perfect. If they were they would not be human."
},{title:"Fact And Truth",body:"Thought experiments (Gedankenexperimenten) are “facts” in the sense that they have a “real life” correlate in the form of electrochemical activity in the brain. But it is quite obvious that they do not relate to facts “out there”. They are not true statements.\n\nBut do they lack truth because they do not relate to facts? How are Truth and Fact interrelated?\n\nOne answer is that Truth pertains to the possibility that an event will occur. If true – it must occur and if false – it cannot occur. This is a binary world of extreme existential conditions. Must all possible events occur? Of course not. If they do not occur would they still be true? Must a statement have a real life correlate to be true?\n\nInstinctively, the answer is yes. We cannot conceive of a thought divorced from brainwaves. A statement which remains a mere potential seems to exist only in the nether land between truth and falsity. It becomes true only by materializing, by occurring, by matching up with real life. If we could prove that it will never do so, we would have felt justified in classifying it as false. This is the outgrowth of millennia of concrete, Aristotelian logic. Logical statements talk about the world and, therefore, if a statement cannot be shown to relate directly to the world, it is not true.\n\nThis approach, however, is the outcome of some underlying assumptions:\n\nFirst, that the world is finite and also close to its end. To say that something that did not happen cannot be true is to say that it will never happen (i.e., to say that time and space – the world – are finite and are about to end momentarily).\n\nSecond, truth and falsity are assumed to be mutually exclusive. Quantum and fuzzy logics have long laid this one to rest. There are real world situations that are both true and not-true. A particle can “be” in two places at the same time. This fuzzy logic is incompatible with our daily experiences but if there is anything that we have learnt from physics in the last seven decades it is that the world is incompatible with our daily experiences.\n\nThe third assumption is that the psychic realm is but a subset of the material one. We are membranes with a very particular hole-size. We filter through only well defined types of experiences, are equipped with limited (and evolutionarily biased) senses, programmed in a way which tends to sustain us until we die. We are not neutral, objective observers. Actually, the very concept of observer is disputable – as modern physics, on the one hand and Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, have shown.\n\nImagine that a mad scientist has succeeded to infuse all the water in the world with a strong hallucinogen. At a given moment, all the people in the world see a huge flying saucer. What can we say about this saucer? Is it true? Is it “real”?\n\nThere is little doubt that the saucer does not exist. But who is to say so? If this statement is left unsaid – does it mean that it cannot exist and, therefore, is untrue? In this case (of the illusionary flying saucer), the statement that remains unsaid is a true statement – and the statement that is uttered by millions is patently false.\n\nStill, the argument can be made that the flying saucer did exist – though only in the minds of those who drank the contaminated water. What is this form of existence? In which sense does a hallucination “exist”? The psychophysical problem is that no causal relationship can be established between a thought and its real life correlate, the brainwaves that accompany it. Moreover, this leads to infinite regression. If the brainwaves created the thought – who created them, who made them happen? In other words: who is it (perhaps what is it) that thinks?\n\nThe subject is so convoluted that to say that the mental is a mere subset of the material is to speculate\n\nIt is, therefore, advisable to separate the ontological from the epistemological. But which is which? Facts are determined epistemologically and statistically by conscious and intelligent observers. Their “existence” rests on a sound epistemological footing. Yet we assume that in the absence of observers facts will continue their existence, will not lose their “factuality”, their real life quality which is observer-independent and invariant.\n\nWhat about truth? Surely, it rests on solid ontological foundations. Something is or is not true in reality and that is it. But then we saw that truth is determined psychically and, therefore, is vulnerable, for instance, to hallucinations. Moreover, the blurring of the lines in Quantum, non-Aristotelian, logics implies one of two: either that true and false are only “in our heads” (epistemological) – or that something is wrong with our interpretation of the world, with our exegetic mechanism (brain). If the latter case is true that the world does contain mutually exclusive true and false values – but the organ which identifies these entities (the brain) has gone awry. The paradox is that the second approach also assumes that at least the perception of true and false values is dependent on the existence of an epistemological detection device.\n\nCan something be true and reality and false in our minds? Of course it can (remember “Rashomon”). Could the reverse be true? Yes, it can. This is what we call optical or sensory illusions. Even solidity is an illusion of our senses – there are no such things as solid objects (remember the physicist’s desk which is 99.99999% vacuum with minute granules of matter floating about).\n\nTo reconcile these two concepts, we must let go of the old belief (probably vital to our sanity) that we can know the world. We probably cannot and this is the source of our confusion. The world may be inhabited by “true” things and “false” things. It may be true that truth is existence and falsity is non-existence. But we will never know because we are incapable of knowing anything about the world as it is.\n\nWe are, however, fully equipped to know about the mental events inside our heads. It is there that the representations of the real world form. We are acquainted with these representations (concepts, images, symbols, language in general) – and mistake them for the world itself. Since we have no way of directly knowing the world (without the intervention of our interpretative mechanisms) we are unable to tell when a certain representation corresponds to an event which is observer-independent and invariant and when it corresponds to nothing of the kind. When we see an image – it could be the result of an interaction with light outside us (objectively “real”), or the result of a dream, a drug induced illusion, fatigue and any other number of brain events not correlated with the real world. These are observer-dependent phenomena and, subject to an agreement between a sufficient number of observers, they are judged to be true or “to have happened” (e.g., religious miracles).\n\nTo ask if something is true or not is not a meaningful question unless it relates to our internal world and to our capacity as observers. When we say “true” we mean “exists”, or “existed”, or “most definitely will exist” (the sun will rise tomorrow). But existence can only be ascertained in our minds. Truth, therefore, is nothing but a state of mind. Existence is determined by observing and comparing the two (the outside and the inside, the real and the mental). This yields a picture of the world which may be closely correlated to reality – and, yet again, may not."},{title:"The Emerald Buddha",body:"The Emerald Buddha is a figurine of a sitting Budha, that is the is the palladium of the Kingdom of Thailand. The Buddha is made of green jade, suprisingly not of emerald, clothed in gold is approximately 45 cm tall.

Other great historians beleive that it belongs to the Chiang Saen Style of the 15th century. The legend says that, it remained in Pataliputra for 300 hundred years, until it was taken to Sri Lanka to save it from a civil war. It was then in 457, that King Anuruth of Burma sent out orders to Ceylon to ask for the Emerald Budha and Buddhist scriptures. These actions took place by the king, to try and support Buddhism in his country. This request was granted, however the ship that was brining the Buddha to Burma, became lost in a storm and ended up in Cambodia. The Buddha made it’s way through several hands after that: Ayutthaya, Kamphaeng Phet, Lao and finally Chiang Rai. It was finally in Chiang Rai that the ruler of the city hid it.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1434 that sources indicate the resurfacing of the statue in Northern Thailand. There is one story about the discovery: “lightning struck a pagoda in a temple in Chiang Rai, after which something became visible under the stucco. The Emerald Buddha was dug out and the people thought the figurine was made from emerald, hence its current name.”\n\nAlthough, the Buddha is just a simple jade statue, it is dressed with garments that are made of fine gold.
